## AWS IAM

#### Components - `IAM users` | `IAM groups` | `IAM roles` | `IAM policy`

- As best practice, it is advisable not to use the root user account for your day-to-day operations. AWS recommends you create separate individual `IAM users` with enough permissions required to carry out all tasks required to fulfil their job function. AWS IAM allows you to create and configure identities for your AWS account. You can apply permissions to those identities, determining the level of access granted.
- When granting access to services, you must follow the principle of least privilege (POLP) as recommended by AWS. This ensures that those identities are provided with only the necessary access needed to carry out approved tasks and perform their job functions. 
- **IAM roles** - An identity independent of any specific user or application with one or more policies that define a set of permissions to access services and resources on AWS. Roles can be assigned to users, aws services, 3rd party entities etc. With IAM roles, it is the STS services that handles creating and managing these temporary credentials in the background.
- **IAM policy** - A JSON document adheres to the IAM policy standard, which outlines the permissions defined by a specific IAM role.

#### AWS IAM - Access delegation workflow
The following diagram depicts how you can establish delegated access across two AWS accounts:

As shown in the Figure, we use the example of a developer in the `Identities` Account that needs to access an `S3 bucket` (called `TodoApp`) in the `Development` Account. This is known as `cross-account access`, and the following are the primary steps involved in configuring this:

1. In the Development Account, you must configure a role with a trust policy that identifies the trusted account (in this case, the Identities Account). In this example, we named the IAM Role `IAM-User-S3-AccessRole` as per the diagram. The configuration requires you to provide the ID for Account A.

2. You will also need to configure a policy that contains the necessary permissions to perform read/write operations against the TodoApp S3 bucket in Account B.

3. Finally, in Account A, you need to configure another policy that grants the developer the ability to assume the S3AccessRole created in Account B. You do this by specifying the Account ID of Account B and the role in the policy statement. The policy will grant the sts:AssumeRole permission as per the following JSON script:

```json
{
  "Version": "2024-06-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::Developer-Account-ID:role/S3AccessRole"
  }
}
```

4. Once the above configuration is in place, the developers can switch roles and access the TodoApp S3 bucket in AWS Account B.

**Note: With the new IAM Identity Center Service (previously known as AWS Single Sign On), you may not need to use cross-account access extensively for IAM users. This is because the IAM Identity Center offers an alternative approach to granting your workforce users access to multiple out-of-the-box accounts in your AWS Organizations. These users can be from AWS Identity Providers as well as external providers.**
