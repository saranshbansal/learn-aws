00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,210
The Kinesis Client Library is an important component of using Kinesis

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,810
and being able to consume and process messages from Kinesis.

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,000
So the KCL helps you consume and process data from a Kinesis Data Stream.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,710
And it's different from the data streams API that is available in the SDKs.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,560
The Kinesis Data Streams API helps you manage many aspects of KDS

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,920
including creating streams, resharding, and putting and getting records.

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,820
The KCL provides a layer of abstraction

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,760
specifically for processing data in a consumer role.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,660
So let's say we have a Kinesis Data Stream and here we have our various shards.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,470
We then have EC2 instances running the KCL worker.

11
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,415
KCL enumerates the shards and instantiates

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,810
a record processor for each shard that it manages.

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,640
We can see that these KCL workers may have multiple record processes.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,560
Each shard is processed by exactly one KCL

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,720
worker and has exactly one corresponding record processor.

16
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,660
So you don't ever need to have multiple instances to process one shard.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,070
But one worker can process any number of shards.

18
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,480
So it's okay if the number of shards exceeds the number of instances.

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,090
So to visualize that we have our Kinesis Data Stream with multiple shards,

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,550
we have a couple of KCL workers each with multiple record processes.

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,860
As I said, each shard is processed by exactly one KCL worker.

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,490
So each of those record processes maps to one shard.

23
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,760
And that's it for KCL. I'll see you in the next lesson
