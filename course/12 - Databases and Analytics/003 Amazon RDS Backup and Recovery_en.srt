00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,509
In this lesson we'll review the backup and recovery options for RDS databases.

2
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:13,861
So we have our RDS database instance.

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,978
We can configure a backup window and we can choose that ourselves or we can leave it as no preference

4
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:21,676
and it gets decided for us.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,573
So if we choose it, then we can set a start time and also a duration.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,685
When we take a backup using an automated backup, it is actually done as a snapshot.

7
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:36,205
And that snapshot can be retained for zero to 35 days.

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,907
Zero just means that you've basically turned off automatic backups.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,640
35 days is the maximum.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,948
You can then restore that snapshot and it creates a new database instance.

11
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:52,593
Restore can be to any point in time during the retention period.

12
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:54,601
You've then got manual backups.

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,061
So this also is using snapshots.

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,850
It backs up the entire database instance, not just individual databases.

15
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:08,153
Note that for single availability zone database instances there is a brief suspension of I/O,

16
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:13,250
so they can cause a slight interruption to your application, which might be in production.

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,770
So bear that in mind.

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,892
And this doesn't happen for multi-AZ because the back up can be taken from the standby instance.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,576
For Multi-AZ SQL Server, the I/O activity is briefly suspended on the primary.

20
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:35,453
For multi-AZ MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL the snapshot is always taken from the standby,

21
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:37,930
so you don't have to worry about that slight interruption.

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,070
Snapshots do not expire, so there's no retention period.

23
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:48,250
So unlike the automatic backups where you must specify how long, up to 35 days, you can actually just

24
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,250
keep these ones forever.

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,630
So what about maintenance windows?

26
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,950
The operating system and database patching does sometimes require taking the database offline.

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,005
So this is where you can specify your maintenance window.

28
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,634
Again, you can leave it as no preference or select your own window and have a start time and day

29
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:08,690
and also a duration.

30
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,880
So the tasks that require the database to be taken offline will happen during the maintenance window.

31
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,213
And by default, there's a weekly window that's actually specified or you just go and choose your own.

32
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,770
So that's all I wanted to cover in this lesson.

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,180
I'll see you in the next lesson.
