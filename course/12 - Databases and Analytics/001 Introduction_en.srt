1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,030
this section is about databases and analytics.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,930
Now of course we did cover dynamodb a bit earlier on in the course.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,040
That is a database technology but it's covered in such a large amount of

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,560
detail in the exam that I had a complete section just for that service.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,030
Now,

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,400
what we're gonna do in this section is cover some of the other database services.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,870
Now we've got to learn about amazon relational database service. RDS

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,600
that's a service we can use for managing relational databases in the cloud

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,180
such as SQL server or SQL we'll also look at amazon elasticache

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,560
which is used for running in memory databases in the cloud.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,320
Lots of different use cases such as session stores or as a

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,340
front end to another database like a relational back end like RDS

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,480
I'll then go into quite a bit of detail on amazon kinesis

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,740
kinesis is a suite of different services

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,260
that deal with streaming data and analytics of streaming data.

16
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,019
And then lastly I'll cover amazon Opensearch, a relatively new service

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,910
and the successor to elasticsearch.

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,450
So lots to get on with. I'll see you in the next lesson
