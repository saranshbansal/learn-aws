00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,995
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,602
We talked a bit in the last lesson about scalability with ElastiCache and now I'm going to go into

3
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:12,714
a bit more detail.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,300
So it depends on which data store you're using.

5
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:20,460
If you're using Memcached then you can add nodes to a cluster.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,200
That's one way of scaling and you can scale vertically by changing the node type.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,798
So ElastiCache runs on EC2 instances.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,436
So you're essentially changing the underlying EC2 instance on which it runs.

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,770
Now, when you do do that, you must create a new cluster manually.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:43,530
So this is not an automatic thing and you can't change your node type within the existing cluster.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,558
So with Redis it's a bit different and we've got the two nodes of course.

12
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:51,180
So firstly you've got the cluster mode disabled.

13
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,133
In this case, you add a replica or you change the node type.

14
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:58,299
And it will create a new cluster and migrate data for you.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,670
We've then got cluster mode enabled.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,796
In this case, you have two options.

17
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:05,029
The first is known as online resharding.

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,740
You can add or remove shards and you can perform vertical scaling to change the node type.

19
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,235
Then you've got offline resharding, again, adding or removing shards and changing the node type

20
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:18,340
or also upgrading the engine.

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,050
And it's a bit more flexible offline than online.

22
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,088
Now, this is going to make a lot more sense when you see it visually.

23
00:01:25,113 --> 00:01:27,056
So let's have a look at some diagrams.

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,755
So this is what Memcached essentially looks like.

25
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,620
There's no shards here, you have a cluster.

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,648
The cluster can be across multiple availability zones and you've got these different nodes.

27
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,325
Now, each node is a partition of data.

28
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,200
It's not a replica of data.

29
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,280
So if you lose a node, you essentially lose the data that was on that node.

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,893
So that's something that's very important to understand.

31
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,741
You're not replicating data here and there's no backup of that data either, which is why you have

32
00:01:55,766 --> 00:02:00,121
to be very careful to be able to recreate that data if you need to.

33
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:04,450
And you have to work out how expensive is it to recreate that data?

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,580
Where does it come from getting loaded?

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,490
How much is that going to cost in terms of things like the the bandwidth, the time?

36
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:15,450
What does it take to actually recreate that data if it's needed?

37
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,230
And what's the impact on the application as well?

38
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,510
We've then got ElastiCache Redis and this is cluster mode enabled.

39
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,885
So as you can see, you have shards.

40
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,790
In this case we have three shards.

41
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,240
They can be within an AZ or they can be across an availability zone.

42
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,910
In each of the shards, you have a primary and then you have one or more replicas.

43
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,344
In fact, you can have zero replica, so zero to five replicas in each of those shards.

44
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,440
Then we have cluster mode disabled.

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,720
So now you can see there's just one shard.

46
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,940
You've still got your primary node and then you've got your replicas, but you can't have multiple shards.

47
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,446
However, your shard can be across availability zones.

48
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,527
Now, that's it for ElastiCache.

49
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:02,706
That should set you up for any exam questions you see.

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,893
Hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next lesson.
