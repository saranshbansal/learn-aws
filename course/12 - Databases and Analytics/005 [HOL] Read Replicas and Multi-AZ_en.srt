1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,210
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,030
We're now going to continue from where we left off before.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,330
And we're going to create a read replica from our Digicloud database and also enable multi-AZ as

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:15,600
well.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,770
Back in the console, I can see my database is here Digicloud.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,810
I've got it selected and under actions, I'm going to create a read replica.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,530
Now, you can then change the DB instance class if you want to.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,880
You can enable multi-AZ, so you have a multi-AZ copy of your read replica database and you can modify

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,480
the storage.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,410
We're going to leave those defaults. Now,

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,620
you can also change the region so you could have a read replica in a different region if you want to.

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,920
You can also specify the availability zone and whether you want this to be publicly accessible.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,440
Now again, I'm going to leave all the defaults.

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,310
We can't actually encrypt because remember with a read replica, it must have the same encryption status

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,430
as the master database that it has been copied from.

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,550
So if the primary is encrypted, then you can have an encrypted read replica or you will have encrypted read

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,900
replica.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,500
There's no two ways about it.

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,750
And if the primary is not encrypted, then it cannot be an encrypted read replica.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,830
I'm going to give a slightly different identifier for my database.

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,990
It's going to be called Digicloud-Replica. And the port is going to be the same.

22
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,110
We're going to keep all the remaining defaults as they are and choose to create the read replica.

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,530
We can now see the Digicloud-replica database in the console here.

24
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,410
So it's a separate database and it's in the creating state. And the Digicloud database is in the modifying

25
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:43,800
state.

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,520
So what's happening is the Digicloud Replica is having the database information replicated across

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,390
to it, so we're creating a replica of that primary instance.

28
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,690
Now, if we click on this identifier, we can then see some information about the database.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,860
Now, in this point in time, because it's not complete yet, it's not available,

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,170
we don't have the endpoints and port.

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,860
So, in a few minutes, we'll refresh and hopefully we'll get a read replica endpoint. Back up a level,

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,340
we can see that the Digicloud Replica is still in the creating state,

33
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,580
but my main database is available. Now,

34
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,850
what I'm going to do while this is completing is select my main database, the primary, choose modify,

35
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,840
and what we're going to do is just scroll down.

36
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,430
We're not changing any of these settings here.

37
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,880
What we want to get to is availability and durability.

38
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,000
And we're going to change to a multi-AZ deployment.

39
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,650
And then just scroll all the way to the bottom and click on continue.

40
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,280
Now, when we want to apply this change, it does warn us that there's a potential performance impact.

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,470
So, you can actually allow this to happen in a maintenance window or you can apply immediately.

42
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,120
We want to apply it immediately. So, make sure you change to that option and then click on modify DB

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,660
instance.

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,230
Both of our databases are now in the modifying state.

45
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,560
The replica database should be finished very shortly.

46
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,790
The main database is now creating a multi-AZ stand by in a separate availability zone.

47
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,900
Now, unlike the replica, it's not a separate DB identifier in here, so you can't see it as a separate

48
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,170
database that you can interact with and point your applications to.

49
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:34,290
But it is being created, and you might have to give this a few minutes be a bit patient, and hopefully

50
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,340
it will be ready very soon.

51
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,900
My replica has now become available. So let's click on the replica and under connectivity and security,

52
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,860
we can see a different endpoint here, so we have a separate endpoint.

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,400
So it's really important to remember that when you have a read replica, your application logic needs

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:01,320
to know to point to the read replica for any queries and to point to the primary database for any database

55
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,800
writes.

56
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:08,850
Now, if we come back up and have a look at the primary database and scroll down, you can actually

57
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:15,120
see under replication here that we have the replica and the replica source is the primary database.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,510
It's in the same availability zone in this case, and it's in a replication state at this point in time.

59
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,240
So, our read replica is almost ready, just replicating at this point. We just need to wait a couple

60
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,150
more minutes now for our main primary database to become available again so that we can have a look

61
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,900
at how we can fail over to our multi-AZ standby.

62
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,310
So that's it.

63
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,170
My database is now available, which means I have a multi-AZ standby ready.

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,950
Now it did take maybe 15 or so minutes to create that standby in another availability zone. But it's

65
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,170
really important to remember that this is a real differentiator of cloud. Before cloud,

66
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,980
this kind of deployment where you have a database and then a multi-AZ standby or read replica even

67
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,830
in another region that could have cost tens to

68
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,340
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

69
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,710
And it would take from weeks to months to actually put together a solution like that with all the planning,

70
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,330
the deployment and the testing.

71
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,760
I know because I've done that many, many times.

72
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:22,480
Now, let's go into our DB identify for the primary database and have a look at what's changed.

73
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,570
Under connectivity and security, we can see

74
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,710
we have the same endpoint.

75
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,980
The endpoint has not changed because it's multi-AZ.

76
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:35,560
This is still where we're going to point our applications. Now, under networking, we can see that

77
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,170
our primary is in US-East-1D.

78
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,770
If we then click on configuration, scroll down a little way, you'll see multi-AZ and we can see the

79
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,740
secondary zone is US-East-1F.

80
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,250
So that's where our stand by instance is running.

81
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,320
Now, if we come back to the top now, by the way, if you don't see that yet, you need to wait and

82
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,100
refresh until you see the secondary zone.

83
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,440
Otherwise, you won't be able to do the next part of the exercise correctly.

84
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:09,610
So, what we're going to do now is go to actions, and from the actions menu you see we can create a read

85
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,660
replica, take a snapshot, restore to a specific point in time.

86
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,820
But what we want to do is reboot.

87
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:22,780
We're going to reboot with failover, and that means we're going to switch the primary from the current

88
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,370
primary to the standby.

89
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,840
The standby will become the new primary in a different availability zone.

90
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,150
So, with reboot with failover selected,

91
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,050
click on confirm.

92
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,020
And again, you'll need to wait a few minutes while that takes place.

93
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,350
So my database has now successfully failed over to the standby.

94
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,520
And so what you can see now is the primary database has change to the US-East-1F availability zone.

95
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:56,230
If we click on the DB identifier, under networking we can see again the availability zone the primary

96
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,890
is running in.

97
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:04,240
If we go to configuration, we can now see the secondary is in US-East-1D, so that's where we

98
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,640
originally had our primary. So, that all looks good.

99
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,340
That's exactly what we were expecting.

100
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:15,760
Now, don't worry if yours hasn't changed availability zones here in the console because sometimes

101
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,460
it does take a few minutes for the console to update.

102
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,620
Now, that's it for this lesson. And we have actually finished with these databases, but I'm going to

103
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,790
leave mine running because I want to show you a couple more things in another lesson.

104
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,660
If you want to, you can go now and delete your database.

105
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,220
You'll simply select your database, click on actions, delete.

106
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,210
You can deselect the option to create a final snapshot.

107
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,090
And just select this option to say that you acknowledge that the database, its automated backups, and

108
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,910
the system generated snapshots will be deleted.

109
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:54,820
Now, don't worry your snapshot that you took earlier the manual one, that will still be here. And we're

110
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,290
going to use that and another lesson.
