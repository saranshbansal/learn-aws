00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,160
Hi, guys. Welcome to this hands-on lesson.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,390
What we're going to do is launch an Amazon ElastiCache Redis cluster.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,200
So let's head over to the console. In the AWS management console,

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,280
I'm on the ElastiCache dashboard and I'm going to choose the get started button.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,620
I can now choose my cluster engine.

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,490
Let's have a look first at the different options available for Memcached.

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,700
We can deploy in the Amazon cloud or on premises if you have AWS Outposts.

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,010
You can then choose a name.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,050
You can specify which version compatibility you want, port numbers and so on.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,830
Now, for node type, we might want to change to t2.micro here. So that's an important point to remember

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,880
about ElastiCache.

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,800
It is based EC2 instances you're paying for these nodes when they're provisioned.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,810
We can now choose the number of nodes we want. With Memcached,

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,870
each node is a separate partition of data.

15
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,150
So maybe I want three nodes.

16
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,640
I can now choose my VPC.

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:12,710
I'm going to use the default VPC and then I can create a subnet group. So, I've given it a name and a description.

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,340
Now, I can select the subnets I want to use. So maybe I want to use A, B, and C.

19
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,380
I can then select the zones.

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,240
So now, I can select which zones I want each of my nodes to be in.

21
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,690
So maybe I'll choose 1A, 1B, and 1C.

22
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:36,230
So now, I'm using three different availability zones, so each partition of data will be in a separate

23
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,770
AZ.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,880
You can then choose your security group and your maintenance window.

25
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,290
So, we're just going to cancel out of here so we don't have anything saved in the console.

26
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,290
Go back to create and choose Redis.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,200
Now, of course, with Redis, we have two options, either just Redis on its own with the cluster

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,960
mode disabled or cluster mode enabled.

29
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,590
Now, I'm just going to scroll up and try to get all this on the screen.

30
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,950
What I want to show you is what changes down here in the bottom part of the screen when I enable cluster

31
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,610
mode enabled.

32
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,720
So, keep an eye on the bottom of the screen, let's select the cluster mode enabled.

33
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:18,470
And as you can see, now, we can specify the number of shots and the replicas per shard. If I turn it

34
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,890
off,

35
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,060
we just get the number of replicas and we have an option for multi-AZ.

36
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,280
Now we're going to leave it off. Let's scroll down.

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,820
Let's give this a name and a description.

38
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,940
I'm going to leave the defaults for the version compatibility and the port and the parameter group for

39
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,910
node type I will change to t2.micro. Click on save. Under subnet group,

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:47,930
I'm first going to change my VPC. Then I'll specify the name of a subnet group and provide a description.

41
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,750
And now we can select the subnet.

42
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,380
So maybe again, I want to choose A, B, and C.

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,390
Let's choose our zones and we've got our primary now and two replicas. So we can have those across different

44
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,560
availability zones.

45
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,170
Now, if I went back up to change the number of replicas here and come back down again,

46
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,040
so now I have a third replica and I could put that in a different AZ.

47
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,020
I'm just going to stick to two replicas. Let's come back down the page again.

48
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,450
Security groups, I'm going to leave as they are.

49
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:26,810
We could select encryption at rest here and choose a default key or a customer managed customer master

50
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,110
key.

51
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,520
I'm going to leave that off.

52
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,520
You can enable encryption in transit and choose from these different access control options.

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,880
So you've got user group Access Control Lists or Redis Auth.

54
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,840
If you use Redis Auth, you have to specify the name of a token.

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,490
We're going to leave it off.

56
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:50,990
You can enable slow logs for slow running queries, and you can seed the data from an S3 location.

57
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,600
Now we're going to leave the remaining defaults, including the backup as enable automatic backups

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,200
with a retention period of one day. For maintenance window,

59
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,930
we'll leave that as the default and just select create.

60
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,150
The database is now in the creating state and we'll just need to wait a few minutes for that to complete.

61
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,990
My database is now ready and we can see the cluster is in the available state and it's all up to date.

62
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,750
If I just expand the menu here, we can see quite a bit of information, including the ARN.

63
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:26,210
We can see the primary endpoints, the engine, availability zones in use and much more.

64
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,420
Now, if you want information about the nodes, click on the cluster name and you can see the nodes

65
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:32,720
here.

66
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,470
Now, I just want to show you a couple of things back up the cluster level first.

67
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:42,170
If we select the cluster in the actionâ€™s menu, we can modify our cluster if we want.

68
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,340
Now, this is where we would go if we wanted to change the node type.

69
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,230
So, if we wanted to scale up, we could come in here and change to a different node type.

70
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,740
I'm going to cancel out of there and then go back in to the nodes. Now, for the nodes

71
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,440
we've got the primary and two different replicas.

72
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,640
If I choose the primary, actions, I can failover the

73
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:13,880
primary. If I choose a replica and go to actions, I can promote the replica. And then also we can scale

74
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,760
horizontally by adding a read replica to the cluster. We just give it a name and then choose the

75
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,560
AZ that we want the replica to be in.

76
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,500
Now, with a node selected, if we drag up this menu at the bottom here, you can see that we have some

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,630
node specific CloudWatch metrics.

78
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,990
And if we select a different node, we can see some different metrics here. So, you can view that information

79
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:42,500
over in CloudWatch, or you can see it here on a per node basis. Coming back up to the cluster level,

80
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,750
if I select the cluster and go to actions, you can also create a backup here as well.

81
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,350
So, with my cluster selected, I can give it a name and choose whoever I want to encrypt the backup and create

82
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:00,050
the backup, and that will then be viewable on the left-hand side under backups. Under events on the left

83
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,580
hand-side

84
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,740
here we can also see some information about recent events for the cluster.

85
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,830
We can see the cluster being created and we can see the different cache nodes being added as well.

86
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,820
So let's head back up to Redis, and I have finished with this cluster for now.

87
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,170
So, what I'm going to do is select the cluster, go to actions, and delete.

88
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,730
I don't want to create a final backup, so I just choose no and then delete.

89
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,420
And that would take a few minutes now to delete your cluster.
