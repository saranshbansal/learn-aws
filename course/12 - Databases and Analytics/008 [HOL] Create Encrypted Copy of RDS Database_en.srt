Hi, guys. In this lesson, we're going to create an encrypted copy of our RDS database.

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,610
Now, as you know, we can't change the status of our existing database in terms of encryption. But

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,610
we already have a snapshot which is unencrypted.

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,740
So, we're going to copy that snapshot,

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:28,190
enable encryption for the snapshot, and then from the encrypted snapshot we'll create a new database

6
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,260
instance that will have its own endpoint.

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,350
So let's go over to the console. Back RDS,

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,940
I'm going to go to snapshots and I have my unencrypted snapshot here.

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,990
I'm going to select the snapshot, go to actions and copy.

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,360
Now I'm going to keep it in the same region.

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,550
I'm going to give it a new identifier,

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,470
Digicloud encrypted.

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,310
We're going to leave the other defaults and just select encryption.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,550
And for encryption we're going to use the standard default AWS RDS key.

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,690
So let's copy this snapshot.

16
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,860
So we can see at the top here that the snapshot copy is being created.

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,900
So, just give it a few minutes until it's created and then we're going to launch a database from it.

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,290
My snapshot has been created, so I'm going to select my encrypted snapshot, go to actions, and restore

19
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:15,920
snapshot.

20
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,070
We can now provide an instance identifier.

21
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,680
I'll call this one Digicloud encrypted.

22
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,990
I'm going to leave it in the same VPC. And in fact,

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,130
I don't need to change any other settings here except for the DB instance class.

24
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,540
So, I'm going to go back to burstable classes. And I can't find the t2.micro on this list but I'll

25
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,180
choose the t3.micro. So, it's up to you.

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,710
If you actually launch this instance, there's a possibility it could cost you a small amount of money.

27
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,480
But we won't have it running for very long.

28
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,060
Now, I'm going to leave the other defaults.

29
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,400
We don't need a multi-AZ standby.

30
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,110
Scroll down to the bottom.

31
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,400
And as you can see, it is an encrypted instance and I can't change that.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,310
It's greyed out. And that's exactly what I'd expect because as you know, we can't create an unencrypted

33
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,470
database from an encrypted snapshot.

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,230
So, I'm going to click on restore DB instance.

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,560
And now I have a new DB Instance being created.

36
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,460
If I click on that instance, go to configuration,

37
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,970
we can of course see that this is an encrypted database. And it's going to essentially be a copy

38
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,590
of our original database.

39
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,070
Now it will eventually have its own endpoint and port.

40
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,890
So, if you leave this to complete, we're going to have a different endpoint here than our other database.

41
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,040
So, we have created a separate database here.

42
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,770
We can't ever change the encryption status of the initial database. And I keep mentioning this because

43
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,650
it comes up in pretty much every single exam.

44
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,330
So, I'm not actually going to wait.

45
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,510
I know what's going to happen there in terms of adding the DB endpoint.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,980
So, what I'm going to do is just go through and delete all of my databases.

47
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,370
Now, you can deselect the option to create a final snapshot.

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,790
We don't want to retain automated backups, and we just select the acknowledge here. Type delete me

49
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,640
and delete. And I'll do that for each database.

50
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,580
So, all of my databases are now deleting.

51
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:14,540
Now, the other thing I want to do is go to snapshots. And under manual, I want to go to actions and

52
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,070
delete both of my snapshots.

53
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:21,980
If you do get an error like I did because the encrypted snapshot was being used to actually create a

54
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:28,070
database, just go back and wait for your databases to complete deleting and then delete your snapshot.
