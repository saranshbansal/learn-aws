Hi, guys.

2
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:12,192
The AWS Cloud Development Kit, CDK, is one of those services that you just about need to

3
00:00:12,217 --> 00:00:14,745
know a little bit of information for the exam.

4
00:00:14,897 --> 00:00:16,637
It doesn't come up very often.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,380
And if it does, it might even just be an incorrect answer rather than a correct one.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,520
So it really it's just about knowing what it is and at a very basic level, what it's useful.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:34,720
The CDK gives you a framework for defining your cloud applications, using programming languages

8
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:37,350
that your development team might be familiar with.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,300
It will provision your resources using AWS CloudFormation.

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,619
So there's a key point here.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,998
You're taking a familiar programming language, for example, Python, TypeScript, Java, and .NET

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,137
and you're then using CloudFormation to deploy your resources.

13
00:00:56,162 --> 00:01:03,030
Now, as you know from our CloudFormation lessons, the CloudFormation templates are written in YAML

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,898
or JSON.

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,092
So maybe your developers aren't familiar with those languages and they want to define their applications

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,470
using Python and TypeScript or Java or .NET.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,065
So that's what the Cloud Development Kit does.

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,598
You can then use existing IDE, testing tools, and workflow patterns.

19
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,525
So let's have a look at the flow of how this works.

20
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:29,733
You download pre-configured application components, you then model your infrastructure using

21
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:33,884
one of those familiar programming languages like type TypeScript or Python.

22
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:37,830
And then you deploy with AWS CloudFormation.

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,370
So you no longer need to use YAML or JSON.

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,365
It means that your developers can stick to what they know.

25
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:46,673
And that's really it for the Cloud Development Kit.

26
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:52,020
You don't need to know anything else for the exam, but just in case it pops up, this bit of information

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,700
should help you.
