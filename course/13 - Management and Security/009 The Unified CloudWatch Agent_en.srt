00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,000
In this lesson, I want to cover a few more details around the Unified CloudWatch Agent.

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:18,130
So, the Unified CloudWatch Agent enables you to collect internal system-level metrics from Amazon EC2

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,250
instances across different operating system versions.

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:28,330
You can collect system-level metrics from on-premises servers as well. And you can retrieve custom

5
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:34,060
metrics from your applications or services and it uses the StatsD and collect the protocols.

6
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:41,770
You can also collect logs from your EC2 instances and on-premises servers for Windows and Linux operating

7
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,340
systems.

8
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:48,580
The agent must be installed on the server and you can install the Unified CloudWatch Agent on Amazon

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:55,050
EC2 and on-premises servers with the Linux, Windows, or macOS operating systems.

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,650
So, there are a couple of things which I want you to take note of in terms of exam questions.

11
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:05,200
Firstly, of course, I've made it very clear that you can install this agent on both these servers,

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,530
in EC2 and also your on-premises servers.

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,130
Now also remember that this is sending log information. And it's essentially in near real time.

14
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:22,690
So, one of the things that sometimes comes up is you want to be able to capture log files when EC2 instances

15
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,320
might be terminated by something like an auto scaling group.

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,400
In that case, once the instance is terminated, you've lost access to that data.

17
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:37,880
But if you were using the Unified CloudWatch Agent, those log files would be sent as they're being generated.

18
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,480
So, you'll have that record of the log files in CloudWatch.

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,090
Another thing that comes up a lot is the difference between standard metrics and the metrics that you

20
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,950
get from the Unified CloudWatch Agent.

21
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,410
Now there's an AWS article linked to this lesson and I'm going to take you there now to go through

22
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,520
a few of those metrics.

23
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,620
When you install the Unified CloudWatch Agent, you get some more advanced metrics.

24
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:06,650
Now, if you have a Windows server instance, what will happen is it will collect the metrics associated

25
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,419
with the Windows performance monitor.

26
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:15,080
So, whatever information is included in Windows performance monitor is now going to be put into Cloud

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,680
Watch logs.

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,890
There's then some advanced metrics for ENA,

29
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:25,880
it doesn't really come up much. But then there's the metrics that you get for your Linux and Mac OS

30
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,930
operating systems.

31
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,450
And as you can see, there's really quite a long list here.

32
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,270
Now, don't worry, you don't need to memorize all of these.

33
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,300
I'll just focus on the ones that do come up a lot.

34
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,880
So, if I keep scrolling down to disk,

35
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,390
we'll see that there's quite a few metrics associated with the disk.

36
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:47,390
We can see the free space on the disks, we can see the used space on the disks, the percentage that's

37
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,020
being used.

38
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,940
None of that stuff comes through in the standard CloudWatch metrics for EC2.

39
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,850
So, you always need the Unified CloudWatch Agent to get that sort of on-disk level metrics.

40
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,600
If we scroll down a bit further and come down to where we have some memory statistics, here, again,

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,400
you've got things like the percentage of memory that's available, the amount of memory that's active,

42
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,780
and the amount of memory that's available to be used by some process.

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,110
So, these kind of utilization statistics with disk and memory don't come through in the standard metrics

44
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,860
for EC2.

45
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,410
So that's where you need the Unified CloudWatch Agent.
