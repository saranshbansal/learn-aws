00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,480
Hi guys. In this lesson, I'm going to create a couple of custom KMS keys.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,180
So those will be customer managed KMS keys.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,630
Now, unfortunately they're not in the free tier,

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,060
so they do cost $1 for each key per month.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,960
For KMS, there's also usage fees,

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,590
but we won't incur any of those because there's a lot of

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,680
allocation in the free tier and we won't come anywhere close.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,160
So I'm on the KMS homepage here and I'm going to choose to create a key.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,440
Firstly, I need to choose whether it's going to be symmetric or asymmetric key.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,870
Now I'm going to use these keys for EC2.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,760
In other words our EBS volumes, RDS and S3, so I need to choose symmetric.

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,520
Let's choose advanced options. We firstly need to choose the key material origin.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,980
So where is our key material coming from?

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,080
Is KMS going to generate it?

15
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,200
Or are we going to provide our own? So external.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,150
Or are we going to use a custom key store CloudHSM.

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,990
Well, I'm going to choose KMS and that means

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,600
I can then enable automatic rotation if I want to.

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,940
For regionality, I'm only going to use this in a single region.

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,360
So I'm happy keeping it as a single region key.

21
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,295
And then I'm going to choose next.

22
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:22,330
For alias, I'm going to call it KMS Key General.

23
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,990
I won't put a description in and I'm not going to put any tags in,

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,660
but you can use tags for things like tracking your costs as well.

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,340
So let's choose next.

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,820
So now, I need to choose the key administrators.

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,010
These are the people who are able to administrate the key.

28
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,550
Now remember, from the theory

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,000
there's administration and there's usage of the key.

30
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,720
So firstly, we define who is able to administer the key.

31
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:50,074
Now, I'm just going to set it for myself, Neal.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,750
And I'm going to allow the key administrators to delete this key as well.

33
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,900
Then I choose next.

34
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,100
And here we have the usage permission.

35
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,220
So who is allowed to perform cryptographic operations using this key.

36
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:06,360
Again, I'm going to choose my own user account.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,168
Then I'll choose next.

38
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,160
And what we'll see here is we get the key policy, so the settings

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,518
that we've just applied through the user interface

40
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:17,960
have now generated this key policy.

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,550
And I don't need to modify this policy but I can see here that we're allowing

42
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,790
the account, so this first ARN here

43
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,450
relates to the account not specifically the root user but the account.

44
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,950
So it's enabling IAM user permissions for this KMS key.

45
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,366
Then we get the allow access for key administrators

46
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:41,700
and we can see the principal and that's my ARN for my account.

47
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm able to perform all these various actions.

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,170
And then we get the usage of the key, and again it's the ARN for my account.

49
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,440
And I can see that I'm able to use the key by performing these API actions.

50
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,080
And there's also some additional permissions here

51
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,720
for things like delegation, so allowing the creation of grants.

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,640
So I'm going to click on finish.

53
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,880
And that's my first key created.

54
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,870
I'm now going to create another key.

55
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,770
Let's create a key. It's going to be symmetric again.

56
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,650
I'm going to leave it as a KMS-generated key material in a single region again.

57
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:21,710
And for alias, I'm going to specify KMS Key EBS RDS.

58
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,930
Now, in this case, I'm actually going to leave these options blank

59
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,250
because what I want to do is come straight through to the policy editor

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,550
and I'm going to delete all of this code.

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,490
And we have some code which we're going to use for this exercise.

62
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,630
So in your code directory from the course download you'll find

63
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,944
AWS KMs folder and then this file, KMS Key EBS RDS.

64
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,870
So what is this one going to do?

65
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,450
Well, as before, we're allowing access for key administrators.

66
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,810
and we're going to specify an ARN here and that's going to be

67
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,856
the ARN of my user account again.

68
00:03:56,983 --> 00:04:02,700
We're then going to restrict key usage to EC2 and RDS.

69
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,260
So again, I'm going to specify the ARN for my user account.

70
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm going to provide the actions for usage here,

71
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,500
and then I'm going to have a condition.

72
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,589
And the condition will be using the KMS via service condition key

73
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,589
and it's checking that were coming from EC2 or RDS.

74
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:26,570
So we should only be able to use this key with EC2 and RDS.

75
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:30,950
So there's a couple of things we need to change here. We need to change the ARN.

76
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,990
And I'm going to put that to my user account and I'm going to do that in two places.

77
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,860
So in the IAM console, I'm going to find my usual account

78
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,810
and then I'm simply going to copy my ARN.

79
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,960
And then I'm going to paste that in here

80
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,270
and make sure I put that into the two different places.

81
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,630
And then we're going to copy this code.

82
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,960
Now note that I have been using us-east-1 region as I mostly do for the course.

83
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,080
And you'll see that we've got us-east-1 in the condition key here.

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,450
So make sure if you are using a different region you need to

85
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,360
specify your user account and then you'll need to change the region here.

86
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,700
So mine is good. So I'm going to copy all of this code.

87
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,380
And back in KMS, I'm going to paste the code into the key policy

88
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,140
and click on finish.

89
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,610
So now we have these two different keys.

90
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,060
They're both symmetric and they allow encryption and decryption.

91
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,910
If we go into the first one we created,

92
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,080
we can see under key policy the key administrators and it's set to me

93
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,530
and the key users and that's set to my account as well.

94
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,590
For cryptographic configuration, again, you can see it's a symmetric key.

95
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,590
The origin of the key material is AWS KMS.

96
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,050
And you can see that it's used for symmetric encryption.

97
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,950
Tags, we didn't specify any.

98
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:55,120
For key rotation because we're using KMS generated key material,

99
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,860
we could enable automatic rotation if we want to for this key.

100
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,630
And you can also create aliases here. So it has one alias.

101
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,760
You can create additional aliases if you like as well.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,360
To go back up and then just check out our other one,

103
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,610
We'll see rather than specifying the user accounts,

104
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,850
all we see is the policy because we actually just generated a policy, added that in,

105
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,060
and we've specified who is allowed to use this key.

106
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,120
Now that's it for this lesson. We now have our two keys and we're going to use those

107
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,070
in subsequent hands-on lessons within this section.
