00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,740
AWS Certificate Manager, ACM is a service that we can use for issuing certificates. And we actually

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,180
used it earlier in the course.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:20,110
Now those certificates are SSL/TLS certificates that we can then use for encryption in transit.

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,230
So let's look at some key facts about ACM.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,160
You can use it to create, store, and renew SSL/TLS X.509 certificates.

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:36,130
You can have single domains or multiple domains and even wild cards on the certificates that you issue.

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,100
It integrates with several AWS services, and those include Elastic Load Balancing,

8
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:50,260
we saw that earlier in the course, Amazon CloudFronts, Elastic Beanstalk, and AWS Nitro Enclaves. And also

9
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,850
AWS CloudFormation.

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,370
The public certificates are signed by the AWS Public Certificate Authority.

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,780
But you can also create your own private certificate authority within ACM, and if you do that, you

12
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,450
can then issue private certificates as well.

13
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,950
You can also import certificates from third party issuers.

14
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,710
You can take key material that you've created, and you can actually import that and create a certificate

15
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,970
in AWS.

16
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,280
So those are really the core facts. The exams not going to go to deep in ACM,

17
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,300
there's not too much you need to know about it.

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:32,140
You just need to be able to differentiate from the certificates that you're issuing with ACM, which

19
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:40,220
are SSL/TLS certificates versus the cryptographic keys that you're issuing using KMS or CloudHSM.

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,100
So make sure you remember which service is used for encryption in transit,

21
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,160
that's ACM, and encryption at rest will be AWS KMS.
