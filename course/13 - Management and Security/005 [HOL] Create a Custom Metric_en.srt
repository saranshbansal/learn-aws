00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,780
Hi, guys. In this lesson, we're going to use the command line to send a custom metric to CloudWatch

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,140
from Amazon EC2. There's a file here from the course download in the CloudWatch folder, EC2-custom-

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,150
metrics. And we're going to use these commands to PUT metric data.

4
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,880
So, it's an AWS CloudWatch command.

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,330
The API action is PUT metric data. And then we supply some information about the metric.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,090
Now, I'm just making this up, right?

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,800
This is just information which I'm putting in.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,830
So, in other words, I can send whatever metrics I want.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,830
Now, what you might want to do in the real world is actually find information from your EC2 instance.

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,850
There's things like Perl Scripts from AWS that can do that for you.

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,100
In fact, I've added a link to an article from AWS which shows you how to do that.

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,980
Now, that article is deprecated because what it's actually trying to do is now covered by the Unified

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,190
CloudWatch Agent which is a much better way of doing it.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,880
But essentially, what it does is run some scripts and finds out information about the resource utilization

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,780
of your instance.

16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,490
And then it will send PUT metric data API commands to CloudWatch.

17
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,950
So what we're doing is just creating our own.

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,470
So, I've created a metric name of Bytes.

19
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,810
I've got my own custom namespace.

20
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,550
The unit will be bytes. And then the value is whatever value I want to put in there.

21
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,980
And the dimensions is then where we can put in the instance ID of our instance.

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,600
So we need to get that in a moment.

23
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,460
The second one has a metric name of Latency in the same namespace.

24
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,420
The unit is milliseconds, and then we have a value for the latency.

25
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,060
And again, we need to enter our instance ID.

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,480
So there's a couple of things we need to do to get moving.

27
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,220
Firstly, I've already launched a t2.micro Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,590
I need to get the instance ID here. Back in my file where it says instance-ID,

29
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,860
I'm just going to paste the real instance ID over the top.

30
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,150
So, I have that now.

31
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,850
The next thing I need is a role which I'm going to attach to my instance using an instance profile.

32
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,520
And that role will supply the permissions to be able to put the metric data in the CloudWatch.

33
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,930
So let's create a new role.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,840
Use case will be EC2. Click on next.

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,670
I need to attach a policy.

36
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,770
I'm going to search for CloudWatch agent and I want this CloudWatch agent server policy.

37
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,670
If you expand this one and look at the JSON, you'll see the action CloudWatch PUT metric data here.

38
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,720
So that's going to be allowed. So, I'm going to select this policy.

39
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,130
Click on next.

40
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,330
Go to review.

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,640
I'm going to give it a name, which in this case is the same as the policy name and then create that

42
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:45,970
role.

43
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,400
Now, I've created the role. I can go back and attach it to my instance using an instance profile.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,240
So, in this case, we're going to select our instance, choose actions, security, modify

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,310
IAM role, and then we're going to select the role which we just created, which is this one here,

46
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,170
CloudWatch agent server policy.

47
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,460
So let's save that role. And now we should have the permissions we need.

48
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:16,480
You'll now need to connect to your instance using SSH. And then we're going to copy this entire command

49
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,370
making sure your region is specified correctly and you've updated your instance

50
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:27,700
ID. I'm connected to my instance using SSH. So, I'm going to put in this command, hit enter. That's

51
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,420
been accepted.

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,990
Copy the second command and run that command now as well.

53
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,620
So, those two commands have been run.

54
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,040
The next thing to do is to go over to CloudWatch and let's see if we can see those metrics being

55
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,110
recorded in the CloudWatch console.

56
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,390
In CloudWatch, let's choose all metrics on the left hand side here. And straightaway

57
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:52,770
we can see under custom namespaces that I've got this my custom namespace. And that's the one that

58
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,210
we defined in our command line.

59
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,930
We can then see that we have the dimensions of instance ID and instance type. And then we have the

60
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,320
two metrics which we just sent, bytes and latency.

61
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,910
So that worked correctly.

62
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,800
Now that's it for this lesson. But I'm going to leave my instance running. And in the next lesson,

63
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,850
we'll see how we can add an alarm for our custom metrics.
