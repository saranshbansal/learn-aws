00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,390
AWS Secrets Manager is designed for storing your secrets like your database connection information

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,830
or your passwords.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,800
It's similar to the SSM Parameter Store that we looked at earlier on, but there are a few key differences.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:26,610
Secrets Manager will store and rotate your secrets safely without needing to create your own custom

5
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,060
code.

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,380
So, in other words, it's offering automatic rotation, and that's built in for a few specific services.

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,010
We've got Amazon RDS with these specific engines.

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,700
We've got Redshift and Amazon Document DB. For any services that are not in that list,

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,930
you'll need to write your own custom Lambda function to rotate your secrets

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,850
same as you would with parameters store.

11
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,220
So let's have a look at a diagram.

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,580
We've got Lambda, RDS, and Secrets Manager.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:03,420
Our Lambda function is going to pull a secret from Secrets Manager and use that to actually connect

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,390
to and authenticate to the RDS database.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,210
Now, the additional thing that we have here with Secrets Manager is in this case because it's Amazon

16
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:19,230
RDS, we can have automatic rotation of those secrets under some kind of periodic change.

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,090
So let's just summarize the differences between Secrets Manager and Parameters Store.

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,710
Automatic key rotation is built in for some services with Secrets Manager. For any other services

19
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,650
you can write a Lambda function to rotate them for you.

20
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,070
There's no native key rotation with Parameters Store, so your only option is to write your own custom

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,470
Lambda function. With Secrets Manager,

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,540
the key value type is string or binary, and it's always encrypted with KMS.

23
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,420
Now you get to store up to 64 kilobytes, so you got quite a lot of information that you can store there

24
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,810
which is more than with Parameters Store. With Parameters Store,

25
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,980
you can store a string, a string list, or secure string, and you can enable encryption, which is also

26
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,980
through KMS.

27
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,500
Now you don't get hierarchical keys with Secrets Manager, but you do with Parameter Store.

28
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,520
The price for Secrets Manager is per secret and with Parameters

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,730
Store, it's free for the standard up to a certain volume and then you pay charges for the advanced

30
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,980
and also, for higher throughput as well.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,200
So that's what I want to cover in this lesson.

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,460
I will see you in the next one.
