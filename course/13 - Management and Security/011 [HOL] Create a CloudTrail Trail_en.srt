1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,070
So let's go into the console now and create a CloudTrail trail.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,910
I'm in the management console on the AWS CloudTrail dashboard.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,990
Now if you just click the create a trail button here, it doesn't give you many options.

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,190
What I prefer to do instead is just expand the options on the left here.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,550
We're going to come down to trails and create a trail.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,980
Now we're going to do that in a moment.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,330
Firstly, I want to show you some of the information that's already available in CloudTrail. On the

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:31,900
dashboard,

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,140
this is where you can see your trails and your event history.

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,760
Another way you can see your event history is by selecting this option on the left.

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,880
So, as you can see, there's already information being generated in here and being stored.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,350
But this will only be stored for 90 days because we haven't created a trail yet.

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,110
But you can see what's happening in the account.

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,650
So, for example, we can see a terminate instances event here. With the event selected, in the bottom here,

15
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,310
we can see some information about this particular API event.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,280
We've got the name, where we can see the actual action,

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,110
terminate instances, the ID, the time that it happened, the user name, and event source.

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,020
Now, as you can see, this is not my account.

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,450
This was not me terminating an instance.

20
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,820
This was in response to an alarm

21
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,390
and so it was AWS that actually terminated that instance.

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,540
And you've got information like the source IP, which in this case is an AWS domain name.

23
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,790
So there's quite a bit of an information log there.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,190
And at the bottom here we have the resource. We have the resource type which is EC2 instance

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,980
and the resource name which is the ID of that instance.

26
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,990
So, we've already got this information, but we want to log it and keep it for a long period of time.

27
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,830
So what we're going to do is go to trails, create a trail.

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,560
As per the suggestion, I'll call it Management Events.

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,790
Now, I'm not going to enable this one for all accounts, it's just going to be for this account.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,220
But within AWS Organizations, you can enable a trail across all of your accounts.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,250
Now, it's going to need a storage location.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,780
By default, it'll create a new S3 bucket and give it a very unique name.

33
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,910
I'm just going to leave that as the default.

34
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,990
I do want to encrypt my information in my bucket.

35
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,460
So, what I'm going to do is select a new key, call it CloudTrail.

36
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,920
We then have log file validation.

37
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,810
This is enabled by default.

38
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,900
What this will do is it will generate a digest of each log file, which cannot be tampered with.

39
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,110
So, it gives you some information about that log file and

40
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,030
you can now determine whether your log files have been tampered with or not.

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,950
So, it's a great way of making sure that you've got that confidence in this information that you might

42
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,690
want to use for auditing or compliance.

43
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,180
Now, I'm not going to enable SNS. And we can optionally enable CloudWatch logs here.

44
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,580
Let's go ahead and do that.

45
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,920
It will create a new log route for us. For logging to CloudWatch logs

46
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,310
it's going to need some permissions.

47
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,400
So, it's going to use an IAM role. In this case,

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,550
we're going to allow CloudTrail to create the role for us.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,850
I'm going to call it CloudTrail Role for CW Logs.

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,470
Let's click on next.

51
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,970
And here you get to select the type of events. We're just going to choose management events.

52
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,400
You could optionally enable data events.

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,830
Now, if you do that and you scroll down, you'll see the different event sources that are available.

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:27,640
We've got S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB. Or if we switch to advanced, then we get more.

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,580
We get Lambda, DynamoDB, Outpost and a few more.

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,560
Now, we're not going to do that.

57
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,260
It does generate a significant amount of information.

58
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,750
We're going to deselect data events.

59
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,960
I'm not going to enable insights events at this time either.

60
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,840
So, we just have management events enabled.

61
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,260
We're going to log, read and write API activity.

62
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,700
Let's click on next and just scroll down and create our trail.

63
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,590
So that's it.

64
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,290
Our trail has been created. And that's all we're going to do for this lesson.

65
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,280
We're going to leave our trail because we're actually going to use the information that's generated

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,030
by that trail with Amazon EventBridge in a couple of lessons time.
