1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,346
In this lesson, we're going to configure some credentials for our command line

2
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:14,260
so that we can enable a user to work with AWS.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,990
Now back in the IAM management console,

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,200
what we're going to do for this particular exercise is I'm going to

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,160
use the user Paul and we're going to configure our terminal for Paul.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,360
So let's go into Paul's account here.

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,430
And what I need to do is I need to generate some security credentials.

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,980
Now you'll remember that when we created the account,

9
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,040
we only enabled management console access.

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,350
That means that Paul doesn't have any access keys to

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:50,460
use for accessing AWS programmatically through the API or the CLI.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,560
So what we do is we go to security credentials,

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,180
we just scroll down and choose create access key.

14
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,820
And what we get here is two pieces of information. We get the access key ID,

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,060
and then we get the secret access key.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,490
Now you shouldn't share this information with anyone because

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,220
this information is all that's needed to be able to access AWS

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,950
as the particular user that it's associated with.

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,840
Now I don't mind showing you because I'm going to delete them.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,250
You can always delete these at any time and create new ones.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,340
So I'm going to copy the access key ID.

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,630
That's the first piece of information I need.

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,060
And I'm going to paste it somewhere where I can keep it securely recorded.

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,200
Then I'm going to select show for the secret access key,

25
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,320
copy that to my Clipboard and store that securely as well.

26
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,560
And I'm now going to configure the credentials on both the Linux instance

27
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:45,610
and the Windows instance that we used in the last lesson.

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,940
I'm back on my Linux instance and I'm going to run the command AWS configure.

29
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,370
The first thing it's going to ask me for is my access key ID.

30
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,720
So let's paste that in, hit enter, and then I need to enter my secret access key.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,250
So I'm going to paste that in.

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,910
Then it asked me for the default region name.

33
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,520
For me, I'm going to use us-east-1.

34
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,730
Then I can hit enter.

35
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:09,419
Enter again.

36
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,360
And we've now configured the CLI.

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,250
So now, if I run a command like AWS S3 LS to list the buckets in my account,

38
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:23,030
rather than getting the unable to locate credentials

39
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,070
instead, it just gives me an access denied.

40
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,880
So it's a slightly different error message.

41
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,360
And the reason for that is we don't actually have any permissions at this stage to S3.

42
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,660
So back in the console, what I'm going to do for the purposes of the demonstration

43
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,460
is I'm going to give some permissions to this user.

44
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,830
So what we're going to do is C Lick on, add permissions,

45
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,690
I'm going to choose to attach existing policies directly.

46
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,060
So this is going to add the policies directly to this user.

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,025
and we're going to choose two different policies.

48
00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:00,950
I want to provide full access to EC2, so I choose Amazon EC2 full access.

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,960
And I want to provide full access to S3.

50
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,770
So I'm going to choose Amazon S3 full access.

51
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:09,810
Click on next and add permissions.

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,240
So rather than using a group, we've added these permissions directly to this user.

53
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,950
Back on my Linux instance, if I rerun this command

54
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,760
now I don't get any error message.

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,060
Now I don't see anything because I don't have any buckets at this point.

56
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,490
But the fact that I don't get an error message shows that we do now have permissions.

57
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,420
And we will work with a few commands in the next lesson to show you how to use the CLI.

58
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,160
When we configured the CLI there were a couple of files that were created.

59
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,460
I want to show you those now.

60
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:43,210
Now, I'm going to use cat, the utility to be able to read the files.

61
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,750
And I put in cat.AWS/.

62
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,490
And there's actually two different files.

63
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,320
One is called credentials and one is called config.

64
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
Now in fact we're going to Config first.

65
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,010
and hit enter.

66
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,280
And this is the contents of the file.

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,850
It literally just has the configuration for the region that I specified.

68
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,160
So nothing particularly interesting other than the default region.

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,380
But if we go into the credentials file,

70
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,950
here we see something really important. So we have the access key ID

71
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,959
and the secret access key.

72
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,558
So of course this is within my usual account on this EC2 instance,

73
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:23,680
but it's stored here in plain text.

74
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,031
It's not encrypted.

75
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:29,760
If you compromise this instance, you compromise these credentials,

76
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,250
and then you can do anything that Paul can do with AWS.

77
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,555
So not particularly secure configuration,

78
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,760
but it's you need to know that this exists here.

79
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,020
So let's now go to our Windows instance

80
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,930
and we're going to configure our credentials on Windows.

81
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,360
Using the command line on Windows, I'm going to also run the AWS configure command.

82
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,000
It's going to ask me for the same information.

83
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,080
So I put in my access key ID, followed by my secret access key.

84
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,960
Again, I'm going to specify us-east-1 as my region, hit enter again.

85
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,650
And now I've configured my command line.

86
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,530
And again I can run a command like AWS S3 LS.

87
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,190
And it shouldn't error.

88
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,720
And if it doesn't, that means then we have permissions to that service.

89
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,400
So that's great. We've configured the credentials for our user account.

90
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,345
Now, just like on Linux,

91
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,760
there are a couple of files that have been created in our file system.

92
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:25,050
So what I'm going to do is just show you quickly

93
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,640
where those are because it's slightly different on Windows.

94
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,050
So on Windows, what I'm going to do is go to my C drive,

95
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm going to go into users,

96
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,870
choose administrator as that's the account I'm logged in with.

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,260
You would just choose whatever your user name is on your computer

98
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,460
and you'll see the .AWS directory is here.

99
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,210
And then you get the same file.

100
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,160
So we have the config which specifies our region and then the credentials file.

101
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,590
And if we open that up with note pad,

102
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,160
just as before, we're going to see the access key ID and a secret access key.

103
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,150
Now, what I've shown you really are the key differences

104
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,665
between running the CLI on windows and Linux.

105
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,370
So the location of the credentials and the config file is obviously

106
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,285
different because the layout of the file system is different between Linux

107
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,260
and Windows.

108
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,350
But other than that, running commands on the CLI is exactly the same.

109
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,950
So of course your directory structure where you store your

110
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,245
files is going to be different on Windows or Linux.

111
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,190
So you need to know where you're storing information

112
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,260
you might want to supply to a command.

113
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,710
But other than that, the actual commands, the AWS commands are exactly the same.

114
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,780
So when I show you commands throughout the course and I'm often using Mac,

115
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,160
it doesn't matter if you're on Linux or Windows or Mac, it's going to be the same.

116
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,000
And that's it for this lesson.

117
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,050
In the next lesson, I'm going to give you more of an overview of using the CLI

118
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,860
and you'll actually get to see some commands in action.
