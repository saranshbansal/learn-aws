00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,768
Hi guys.

2
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:10,430
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to install the AWS Command Line Interface.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,860
We're going to install it on a Linux instance and also on a Windows instance.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,630
AWS provides some great instructions.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,250
So what I'm going to do is use Google to search for AWS CLI

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,610
Now, what you'll see here is the AWS Command Line Interface comes up

7
00:00:27,816 --> 00:00:32,759
and the best way to go here is to choose the installing your updating

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,350
the latest version of the CLI.

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,030
So now you've got the instructions.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,170
Now, they're really easy to follow, but I'm going to show you on Linux and Windows.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,500
Now, if you use Mac Os, I do as well.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,760
It's also extremely simple.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,949
So you can simply download the package file here

14
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:53,250
and follow the on screen instructions or you can choose to use

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,920
these other options as well. It's much easier just to download the package.

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,130
Just double click it and then it's simply a case of running the installation.

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,850
So I'm going to show you how to use the installer for Linux first.

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,480
Now, what we need to do for Linux is just run a series of commands.

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,896
So what I'm going to do, there's one option here

20
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:15,160
to kind of get all the commands in one go.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,231
or you can run them separately.

22
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:20,615
Now, I'm going to use an EC2 instance for Linux.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,000
It's running Ubuntu.

24
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,411
Now, if you use the Amazon 2 Linux AMI, which we use throughout the course

25
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:28,260
it already has the CLI installed.

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,720
So you don't need to do anything.

27
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,550
So what I'm going to do here is simply

28
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,910
copy this first command which downloads the installer.

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,960
Logged into my Ubuntu instance, I'm going to paste in that command.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,840
And it simply downloaded the file.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,960
So if I run LS, I can now see that I have the installer.

32
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,460
Next I come back,

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,251
take the unzip command to my clipboard, paste that in just to unzip the file.

34
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:57,560
In this case I don't have the unzip utility installed on Ubuntu

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,960
so that means I just have to run this command.

36
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,250
So we just run Sudo apt install unzip.

37
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:04,353
That's done.

38
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:06,470
I'm just going to clear the screen to bring this back up

39
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,350
to the top so you can see it more easily.

40
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,560
And then we rerun the unzip command.

41
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,380
And that's going to unzip all those files.

42
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,850
If I run LS again, you can see we now have this directory.

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,700
Then what we need to do is run Sudo./AWS/install.

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,760
So I copy that to my clipboard, come back,

45
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,250
paste that in and that should now be installed.

46
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,450
Now it tells me I can run user local bin aws --version.

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,560
And that should then show me the version of the CLI that's running.

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,490
You should also be able to just run AWS on its own.

49
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,436
So then you can see the various options that are available to you using the CLI.

50
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,000
Now, we're going to go into more details about how to use the CLI in another lesson.

51
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:55,460
So that's how you install the CLI on Linux using the command line.

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,351
So next I want to show you how to do it on windows.

53
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:00,350
So for windows it's quite simple.

54
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:04,980
All we need to do is download and run the CLI MSI installer.

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,210
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this to my clipboard.

56
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,110
I'm now on an EC2 instance running Windows.

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,850
And what I've done is pasted in that link to the MSI into my browser.

58
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,460
Let's just download this file. I need to click on save.

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,450
And the file has been downloaded.

60
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,838
Now just before we install, I just want to show you in a command prompt.

61
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:28,950
If I type AWS, it says it's not recognized as an internal

62
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,960
or external command so it's not actually known

63
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,860
as a utility that's installed on this system.

64
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,140
So I'm going to click on run at the bottom of the page here.

65
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,530
And that's going to run the MSI installer.

66
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,810
And it's just simply a case of clicking next,

67
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,960
accepting the license agreement,

68
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,760
and then going through and allowing the default options,

69
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,183
and that's going to be installed very quickly.

70
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,460
Then I'm going to click finish.

71
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,960
And let's come back to our command prompt and try and rerun AWS.

72
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,925
And that's not allowing it.

73
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,380
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to close that out.

74
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,970
Let's open it again.

75
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,560
That might make a difference.

76
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,460
So I'm just going to search for cmd,

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,020
open the command prompt, type AWS,

78
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,710
and this time we can see that we do get a response.

79
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,209
So you can also run AWS --version

80
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:21,920
and that will then show you the version that's actually installed.

81
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,360
So it's the AWS CLI version two.

82
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,025
So that's how you install the CLI on Linux and windows.

83
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:32,050
As I mentioned, very simple on Mac as well, you just download the package installer

84
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,011
and run it.

85
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:37,160
Now, we're not able to do anything with our CLI at this point.

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,230
And the reason is we don't actually have any credentials, so we

87
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,050
don't have any permissions to be able to work with AWS.

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:53,498
So for example, if I run a command such as the AWS S3 LS command,

89
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:58,760
and this will list any buckets which we have in the Amazon S3 storage service.

90
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,080
And what will get as a response is unable to locate credentials.

91
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,460
So we have to run this command, AWS configure

92
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,920
and we have to supply some information which will enable

93
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,290
us to have the permissions to speak to AWS services.

94
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,660
And that's something we're going to do in another lesson.
