1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,383
In this lesson, I'm going to give you an overview of actually using the

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:13,060
command line interface and you'll get to practice some basic CLI commands.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm logged into my Linux instance and I have my CLI installed here.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,270
And it's configured with Paul's credentials.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,540
So we'll be able to run commands as Paul.

6
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,540
Now, you need to have the AWS configure

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,310
command run and you'd supply it some credentials.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,060
We did that in a previous lesson.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,418
And you can be on any operating system.

10
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:35,750
It doesn't matter if you're using Linux, Mac, or windows.

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,990
So let's run a couple of commands.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,760
First, I'm just going to run AWS Help.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,620
The help menu gives us contextual information about

14
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,180
the command that we're running, in this case, simply the AWS command.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,160
So it tells us a description, synopsis, and it provides some of the options.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,903
We can see some information here.

17
00:00:55,928 --> 00:00:59,030
We can just keep hitting our space bar to go through

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,130
Then under available services, we can see the various services

19
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,960
that we can interact with using the CLI.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,750
So you'll see there's hundreds of services in here.

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,060
Now typing Q, I'm able to quit.

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,830
And then I can run another command and in this case,

23
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:21,760
what I'm going to do is I'm going to choose to run the help command against AWS EC2.

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,330
So now I get the help menu specifically for the EC2 command,

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,760
so any of the commands that are related to the elastic compute cloud.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,320
So again here, if we scroll through, we'll see quite a bit of information.

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,160
These are all of the options for how we can work with Amazon EC2.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,750
So if I just keep hitting enter,

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,280
you can see lots of options to copy, to cancel, to create.

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,520
If we go down a bit further, you'll see that you can delete things

31
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,150
using the CLI, so you can do pretty much anything with the CLI.

32
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,750
If I just keep going down a bit further,

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,245
we'll get down to the describe.

34
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,450
So here we can see we've got the describe options.

35
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,110
Let's just scroll down a little bit further. We'll hit enter a couple more times.

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,710
And what I should find is the describe instances.

37
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,160
We can see it right at the bottom of my screen here.

38
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,650
So that's an interesting command that will

39
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,623
give us some information about the instances running in the account.

40
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,790
So let's quit.

41
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,480
And what I'm going to do now is run AWS EC2 describe instances.

42
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,600
Now, of course, this particular user does have

43
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,160
privileges to EC2, and I am actually running a couple of EC2 instances.

44
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,620
So if you're not you won't get any output.

45
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,250
But in this case I have two instances running.

46
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,870
And we can see some information here about those instances.

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,950
So lots of information is returned.

48
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,560
So that's EC2.

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,960
Let's now have a look at AWS S3.

50
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,560
So if I type AWS S3,

51
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,860
and then help,

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,750
we can see the various different command options.

53
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,630
Now S3 is the simple storage service

54
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,520
and it's an object-based storage system that you'll learn about later in the course.

55
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,490
So again we get quite a bit of information about the command,

56
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,070
and then we can see various options and examples of how we can use it.

57
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,560
Now, what I'm going to do is just quit out of there.

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,280
And we're going to run a couple of commands.

59
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:29,020
Firstly, I'm going to run the command AWS S3 mb.

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,190
Now mb is used to create a bucket and bucket is simply the container

61
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,660
into which you can upload files.

62
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,760
I then need to type S3://

63
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,151
and I need to put in a bucket name.

64
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,760
So I'm going to call it my test bucket.

65
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,230
And the name has to be unique across Amazon S3.

66
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,960
So I'm just going to put in a bunch of random characters to make sure it's unique

67
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:55,380
and then hit enter.

68
00:03:55,663 --> 00:03:56,750
And that was unique.

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,483
So I was able to create the bucket.

70
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:06,430
So if I now run AWS S3 LS, we can then see that we have a bucket.

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,940
Now, what if I want to copy something to S3?

72
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,575
Well, let's create a file.

73
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,370
So I'll create a file simply called testfile.txt.

74
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:20,660
Of course it's an empty file but it does exist now on my hard drive.

75
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,530
So what I'm going to do then is run AWS S3 CP.

76
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,930
This is copy, so I'm going to copy the file.

77
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,530
So I gave the path to the file, testfile.txt and then S3://.

78
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,530
And I'm going to take my bucket name from here,

79
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,440
paste that in and hit enter.

80
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,300
So now that file has been uploaded.

81
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,370
So what I can now do is actually view the contents of the bucket.

82
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,750
So I'm going to copy the bucket name.

83
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,670
So S3:// and then the bucket name to my clipboard,

84
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,550
run AWS S3 LS, put in the bucket,

85
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,460
and we can see the contents of the bucket and it has the test file in it.

86
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,560
So that's super simple, very easy to work with S3 from the command line.

87
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,270
Now I finished with this particular test.

88
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,250
So what I want to do is actually remove my bucket.

89
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,340
Now, the way I do that is I type in AWS S3 RB for remove bucket,

90
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,810
and then I put in the bucket name.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,931
Now we do actually have a file in the bucket.

92
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,950
So what happens is if we hit enter

93
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,360
it doesn't actually work and it tells us that it's not empty.

94
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,060
All we need to do to fix that is type --force, hit enter,

95
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,631
and now it's been removed.

96
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:41,180
So if we run AWS S3 LS, we no longer have any buckets.

97
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,070
So that's it for this lesson.

98
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:45,600
Really just a basic overview. Once you know how to

99
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,380
work around the commands and use the help menu, it's very easy.

100
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,150
Now I do highly recommend using Google anytime you get stuck

101
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,210
with using the CLI, you'll find lots of examples online.

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,890
And just to show you a quick example, if I had an EC2 instance and I wanted

103
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:06,480
to delete it using the CLI,

104
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,590
I could type easy to delete CLI,

105
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,600
and then we find some options here.

106
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,920
Now, the actual terminology for EC2 is terminate.

107
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,940
But even if you didn't know that and you put delete, you would find the answer.

108
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,220
Now you can see there is a delete instance but that's for ops works.

109
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,620
So by selecting the entry here I can then find

110
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,410
lots of information about how to terminate the instance,

111
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,120
the various different command line options.

112
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,480
And there's typically also an example which you can then use.

113
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,260
So that's it for this lesson. I'll see you in the next one.
