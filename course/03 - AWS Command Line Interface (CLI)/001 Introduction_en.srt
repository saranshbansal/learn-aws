Hello and welcome to this section.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,689
This section is all about the AWS command line interface, the Cli

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,950
So we will be using the Cli quite a few

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,710
times in the hands on lessons throughout the course.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,050
So this section is about getting you prepared

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,750
now it is a short section but it's very useful.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,650
So what we'll do is we'll look at how we can install the Cli on our computers,

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,750
whatever operating system you're running.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,660
Then we're going to configure credentials that we

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,420
have authentication and access to AWS Resources.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,150
I'll show you around the Cli teach you some

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,800
of these sort of fundamental ways you can navigate,

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,150
find help and use some basic commands.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,000
And then lastly we're going to carry on from what we did at the

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,960
end of the previous section where we actually assumed a role using the console

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,210
in this section.

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,260
What we're going to do is assume a role using the cli a really useful technique.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,160
So I hope you enjoy it and I'll see you in the next lesson.
