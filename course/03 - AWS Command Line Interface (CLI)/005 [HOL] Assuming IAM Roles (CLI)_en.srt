1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,030
In this lesson,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,570
I'm going to show you how you can assume a role using the Command Line Interface.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,460
Now back in the IAM management console, we're going to go to users and Paul.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,930
And what I want to do is I'm actually just going to remove these

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,138
managed policies.

6
00:00:21,323 --> 00:00:25,260
So I'm going to detach the Amazon EC2 full access.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,460
I'm also going to detach the S3 full access.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,520
So that means Paul no longer has permissions.

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,650
So what Paul is going to do is use the CLI to actually assume a role.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,050
So what I then want to do

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,510
is go to roles, come down to EC2 full access.

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,820
This is the role that Paul is going to assume just like

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,760
when we did it in the management console in a previous lesson.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,070
In this case, he's going to assume the role

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,150
and hes going to have EC2 full access just as before.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,560
Now what I need is the ARN of the role. So I'm copying that to my clipboard.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,400
You will then find in the course download

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,250
that in the code directory IAM,

19
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,980
we have this profile, EC2-full-access.config file.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,480
And what we need to do here is pace the ARN of our role. So mine has already been done.

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,350
So make sure you've got the correct ARN with your account number and your role name.

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,150
We'll then copy this to our clipboards.

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,160
So I copy that to my clipboard.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,710
And I'm going to show this demonstration on Windows remember on Windows,

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,760
the location of the config and credentials files is users administrator and .AWS.

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,360
Now, just to prove that I don't have access, I'm going to run AWS EC2

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,590
and then describe instances.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,133
Hit enter.

29
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,240
And it tells me I'm not authorized to perform this operation.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,920
So what I need to do is open up the config file.

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,760
I'm going to open it with notepad, click OK.

32
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:04,050
And in here what we're going to do is paste in that information.

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,180
So what we have is we have a default profile.

34
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,080
Now when we run the AWS commands it's going to run as the default profile.

35
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,360
And all that we have in here is the region us-east-1.

36
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,650
Now, in this case it then uses the credentials that are in the credentials file.

37
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,580
But what we're doing now is we're specifying another profile,

38
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,360
which is EC2-full-access.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,960
When this profile is used and it's something that we specify on the command line,

40
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,010
it's going to assume the role that has this role ARN.

41
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,560
It's not using the credentials in the credentials file.

42
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,550
So that's all I need to do there. I can click on save.

43
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,660
I can come back and rerun the command but this time

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,567
I'm going to type --profile and then I'm going to copy

45
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,850
this name here. So this is the name of the profile

46
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,150
and then simply paste that in.

47
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,490
Hit enter.

48
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,560
And now I actually get a response.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,320
Now I have instances running so I can see

50
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,490
information about those instances.

51
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,340
If you don't have any instances then what you'll

52
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,460
find is you just don't get an error message.

53
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,060
Let's also add S3 permissions now to the role not to Paul

54
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,650
and let's see if we can run some commands using S3.

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,240
So back under roles,

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,730
what I'm going to do is I'm going to add permissions, attach policies, type in S3,

57
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,260
choose the S3 full access,

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,820
attached, and that's been attached.

59
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,270
Now if I come back and I run AWS S3 LS,

60
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,780
then I'm not going to be able to run this command, it's access denied as Paul.

61
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,120
But if I add the profile information,

62
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,300
then it should work.

63
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,750
So let's hit enter again.

64
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,040
And this time I don't get a response.

65
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,860
So it's really easy to assume roles from the command line.

66
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,980
Now we can also

67
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,060
add additional profiles with different credentials if we want to as well.

68
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,560
So for example I can run AWS configure.

69
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,980
This time I'm going to put in -profile Neal.

70
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,550
So I'm going to create my own profile, hit enter,

71
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,459
And it's going to ask me for my access key ID and secret access key.

72
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,210
So back in IAM, I'm going to generate some security credentials for my account.

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,010
I already have an access key,

74
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,580
but I'm going to create a new one just to show you how to do it again.

75
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,150
Let's copy my access key ID, paste that in.

76
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,420
I now need the secret access key

77
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,440
so let's copy this to my clipboard,

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,430
paste that in. I'm going to select the us-east-1 region again

79
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,050
as my default region.

80
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,890
And that's the command completed.

81
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:52,560
So now I can run commands as myself. So again I can run AWS S3 LS.

82
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,920
And this time I can choose --profile Neal.

83
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,270
And I get a response using my particular profile.

84
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,360
Now what you'll see now if I just close this file so that I can refresh it

85
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,370
is when I go into the config file,

86
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,150
we have another profile for Neal with us-east-1.

87
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,760
And then if we go into credentials,

88
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,870
we'll now see two sets of credentials.

89
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,090
So we have the default credentials which in this case is Paul

90
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,250
and then we have the credentials for the Neal user as well.

91
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,341
So that's how that all works.

92
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,906
I hope that was useful and I'll see you in the next lesson.
