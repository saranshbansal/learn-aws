00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,230
In this lesson,

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,610
we're going to have a look at the settings for usage plans and API keys.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,570
So back in API Gateway first I'm going to go down to API keys.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,360
This is very simple. What we're gonna do in here is literally just create API key.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,120
We're gonna give it a name so I'd suggest customer name.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,310
So, you know, this could be sort of customer A.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,160
And then we can allow it to auto generate. So let's click on save.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,940
And now we have an API key.

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,660
So if we just go back to our API

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,600
and now choose usage plans, we can create usage plans.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,760
And it's given us an example here of basic. So let's create one called Basic.

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,050
So we have Basic and we can enable throttling.

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,460
Maybe for our basic plan we only want to enable 500 requests per second

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,470
and a burst of 50.

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,160
We can also enable a quota of requests per month.

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,769
So maybe that one will be 10,000.

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,150
Let's click on next.

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,390
You can now associate with a stage, we'll skip that for now and click on done.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,790
Then let's create another usage plan and this one is going to be advanced.

20
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,410
So this could be another tier that you're selling to your customers.

21
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,160
So perhaps this time we've got 1,000 and 500

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,430
and here we have 50,000 per month.

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,790
So now we've given

24
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,550
more resources or more ability to consume resources to this particular customer.

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,860
So click on skip and then done.

26
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,850
So we now have our two usage plans. One is called basic.

27
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,250
That's going to be for our customers who are paying a lower rate to us

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,910
and then advance would be for our customers who are spending a bit more money.

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,560
and they get more resources available to them.

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,620
We can add API keys in here now.

31
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,860
So you can add an API key to your usage plan.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,500
If I just type space

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,560
it will then show the keys I have available.

34
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,560
So I'm going to use the tick box to select that key.

35
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:08,560
Come back.

36
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,470
Also I can add a stage.

37
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,160
So if I add a stage then I can choose the Lambda simple proxy API.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,150
And then choose the stage within that API. So let's say prod.

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,560
And click on the tick mark.

40
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,540
So there you can see that we have now associated

41
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,520
our usage plan with an API and an API stage.

42
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,670
There's also method throttling.

43
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,010
So you can configure throttling at the method level as well.

44
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,410
So for example here we can add

45
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,360
the resource and the method, so we have star or we have /Hello world.

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,710
And then you can choose the methods from the list of available methods

47
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,780
that you want to set your request rate and burst rate to.

48
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,050
So here we only have one method but if

49
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,630
we had multiple methods we could choose one of them

50
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,060
and say well, for this specific method I want to have a different rate

51
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,790
like a lower rate for example.

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,350
So that's method specific throttling.

53
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,660
So that's it. I finished with this API.

54
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,260
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go and delete the API.

55
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,430
So just choose actions and delete

56
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,280
and it will delete our API.

57
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:19,360
That's it for this lesson. I hope you enjoyed it. I'll see you in the next one.
