1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,210
In this hands-on lesson, we're going to create an event bus and rule that triggers based on state

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,670
changes in EC2.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,860
So, we saw this example in the previous lesson.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,630
It's simply going to be a state change in EC2 where we terminate an event.

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,050
And that should trigger an email via an SNS topic.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,960
Now, in EC2, I've already launched an instance. So, you'll want to go ahead and just launch an instance

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,290
and then copy the instance ID to your clipboard. In EventBridge,

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,510
we're going to create a rule.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:42,040
I'll give it a name, EC2 State Change. And then I'm going to choose event pattern, predefined pattern

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,540
by AWS service.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,930
The service provider is going to be AWS, then EC2. For event type,

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:56,500
you want to choose EC2 instance state change notification. And then we're going to change to specific

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,170
states and I'm going to choose terminated.

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:07,860
For instance, I can actually add my specific instance ID. So, we can now see the event pattern has

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,180
been recorded here.

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,450
We're looking at the source aws.ec2.

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,600
We're looking for an instance state change notification, and specifically, we're looking for terminated

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,080
events related to this specific instance.

19
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,810
Next, we need to specify a target.

20
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:31,440
So, I'm going to choose SNS and then for topic, we already have a topic here from earlier in the course.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,020
So, I'm going to choose my email notification and then simply create this rule.

22
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,430
So that rule is enabled.

23
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,150
Let's go and terminate our EC2 instance and see what happens.

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,630
So, back in EC2, I'm simply going to terminate my EC2 instance. And then, I need to go and check my email

25
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,970
and see if I've received a notification.

26
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,160
So, here is the notification message that I received about 30 seconds later.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,580
We can say it's an instance state change notification from EC2. We've got some information about the account,

28
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,620
the time it occurred, the region, and the resource specific information as well.

29
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,950
So that's a simple example of using an EventBridge rule to trigger an action based on a state change

30
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,850
in EC2.
