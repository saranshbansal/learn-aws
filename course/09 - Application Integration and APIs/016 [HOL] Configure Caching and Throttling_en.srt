Hi guys. In this lesson, we're going to have a

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,160
look at the caching and throttling settings for our API.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,195
So back in API gateway, I already have my Lambda simple proxy REST API.

4
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:19,860
So let's choose the REST API here.

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,700
And if I go down to stages,

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,560
we've got the prod stage.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,350
And here we can enable an API cache.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:35,050
Now this is the stage level so, for example, we can go up and deploy another stage.

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,760
So let's create a

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,160
test stage,

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,450
deploy

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,960
now we have two stages so we can configure

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,250
an API cache on one stage but not another. So all of these settings are tage-specific.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,790
And as you'll see

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,150
the stages each have their own invoke URL.

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,850
So here we have /test on the end whereas for our prod stage we have /prod.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,060
So to enable an API cache we simply enable this option here.

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,130
And then we specify

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,020
the capacity settings. So for example 0.5 gigabytes

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,330
in terms of the capacity of the cache.

21
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,880
And note that the API

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,360
cache does increase costs and it's not covered by the free tier.

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,750
So I'm not going to enable it.

24
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,760
You can encrypt your cache as well

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,860
and you can specify the time to live, so how long something should remain in the cache.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,470
So maybe I'll set that to five minutes

27
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,860
or 300 seconds. Under pair key cache invalidation,

28
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,760
we can require authorization.

29
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,100
And we've got some settings for handling unauthorized requests.

30
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,960
We can then enable or disable throttling.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,850
So this will set the rate of requests that are allowed to our API.

32
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,720
Now we've enabled here 10,000 requests per second.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,050
That is the account level throttling rate.

34
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,760
And also

35
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,390
There's a burst limit here of 5000.

36
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,260
So you'd have to go to WS if you wanted to exceed that.

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,560
You can easily reduce it here if you want to as well.

38
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,790
And then you'd simply save changes if you wanted to save these changes,

39
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,770
which I'm not going to.

40
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,900
So that's all I wanted to show you in this lesson.

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,150
It's quite simple to enable caching and throttling.

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,870
And again for the exam,

43
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,760
just make sure you remember that the settings are specified at the stage level.
