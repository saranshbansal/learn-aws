00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,340
Hi guys. In this lesson, we're going to go into AWS CodeCommit.

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,540
I'm going to show you around and we're going to create a repository.

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,050
And then we're going to clone that repository down to our computers.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,260
So I'm logged on and I'm on the dashboard for AWS CodeCommit.

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,690
Now, as you can see on the left hand side here,

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,970
we've got the developer tools and we're actually focused on CodeCommit,

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,760
which is dealing with source code.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,940
But then we've got CodeArtifact for artifacts,

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,120
CodeBuild for running builds and tests, CodeDeploy for running deployments,

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,500
and CodePipeline for creating pipelines.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,750
So we're going to work with multiple of those services in this section.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,110
For now, all we're going to do is focus on AWS CodeCommit.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,870
I've clicked on repositories and I'm going to create a new repository.

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,160
And I'm going to call this one Developer-Labs and click on create.

15
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,520
So that's all there is to actually creating a repository.

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,325
Now we can see there are some connection steps.

17
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,610
We've got HTTPS, SSH, or HTTPS GRC.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,030
With HTTPS, this is the URL for cloning.

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,560
In fact this is the entire command for cloning the repository down to our computers.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,820
And we will go ahead and do that.

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,350
But first, we need to go to IAM and we need some credentials.

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,650
So I'm going to click on users, choose my user account.

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,560
On the security credentials page, we just scroll down.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,960
You'll see here we have HTTPS Git credentials for CodeCommit.

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,860
So what we need to do is generate credentials.

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,930
And just like with access keys, we're going to copy the access key

27
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,060
and the password somewhere so we can enter it when we're cloning our repository.

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,000
Back in CodeCommit, I'm going to copy

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,460
the command to clone the repository.

30
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,220
And on the command line I'm going to run this command.

31
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,820
So it's now cloning our repository.

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,460
And it wants my username.

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,270
So I've entered my username and now it needs the password.

34
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,570
Once you've entered the password, hit enter.

35
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,560
And then it just warns us to let us know that we've cloned an empty repository.

36
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,060
And that's expected. We don't have any code in our repository at this point in time.

37
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,350
So now I should be able to change into that repository.

38
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:21,370
And there it is.

39
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,410
So I've changed directory to Developer Labs

40
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,450
because that's the name of the repository.

41
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,360
So it's created that directory when I did the cloning.

42
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,610
So now I have my master branch for Developer Labs.

43
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,610
But there's nothing actually in there at the moment.

44
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,520
So let's test creating a file and then committing

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,160
that file and pushing it up to our repository.

46
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,936
So I'm going to create a file. Just like before I'm going to call it my test file.

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,290
So now, if I run Git status we know that we have an untracked file.

48
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,950
I'm going to run Git add -A

49
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,970
That's going to add the file.

50
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:59,750
Then I'm going to run Git Commit -m and I'm going to call this first commit.

51
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,850
Hit enter.

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,080
And now let me just bring this back up to the middle of the screen.

53
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,700
What we can now do is run Git push.

54
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,630
And that's going to push it up to our repository

55
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:13,150
And we can see that's happened.

56
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,960
So let's go back to CodeCommit and have a look.

57
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,060
Back in CodeCommit. I'm going to refresh the page.

58
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,760
And now we can see that we have our test file.

59
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,650
So very simple test just to add a file.

60
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,350
While we're here, let's go to settings and have a look around CodeCommit.

61
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,270
So first we have the repository name here. So I'm in the settings for my repository.

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,740
You'll see that we also have notifications so we

63
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,160
can actually create notifications based on certain triggers

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,330
like commits, on pull requests, on status changed and so on.

65
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,460
And then for targets we've got SNS topics or AWS chatbots slack.

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,336
Then we have triggers.

67
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,660
If I choose to create a trigger here, we can give the trigger a name.

68
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,160
Choose the event that we want to actually cause the trigger to be executed,

69
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,490
And then the service to use. So either SNS or AWS Lambda.

70
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,870
You can also add tags to your repository and use code guru reviewer

71
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,060
to give you some recommendations on improving your Java and Python code.

72
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,600
And that's all there is for this lesson. Don't delete your repository.

73
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,850
We will be using it again.
