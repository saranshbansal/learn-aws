00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:11,940
Hey, guys, you've already learned lots about Amazon EC2 and how to deploy EC2 into VPC.

2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:18,920
Now we're going to look a little more into the storage layer for our EC2 instances, specifically at

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,750
the Amazon Elastic BLOCK Store EBS and Instant store volumes.

4
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:31,040
So first, let's look at EBS volumes and by default, when we launch our instances, they have one attached

5
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,950
EBS volume, but you can attach more.

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:41,000
So an EBS volume is a block based storage that's actually attached over a network.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,700
So the EBS volume does not actually exist on the AC to host.

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,450
It actually exists over a network, but it's attached at the block level.

9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:57,590
And of course that means that the volumes appear as disk drives, which can be formatted and have a

10
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,500
drive letter assigned to them on a Windows machine like this.

11
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:07,220
In this case we've got our C and our DD drive, so the volume is attached over a network and of course

12
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:14,480
we can attach EBS volumes to any EC2 instance, whether it's a Windows Linux or Mac OS instance.

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,530
The EPS volumes exist within and availability zone.

14
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,410
And as we can see here, they are in the same availability zone as our EC2 instance.

15
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:31,370
The volume is automatically replicated within the availability zone, so AWS are replicating it on the

16
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,470
back end to ensure durability for the data.

17
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,980
There are several types of EBS volume.

18
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,880
These are a few.

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,350
There are other types as well.

20
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,850
But I just want to give you an overview of some of the more commonly used volume types.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,210
Now the GP2 has been around for a long time.

22
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:54,410
That's our general purpose SSD and in the provisioned IOPS on the right here we have the IO one.

23
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,600
So these are both solid state drives.

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,810
That means they're very high performance.

25
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,400
Now the older style of hard disk drive is still available, but it's less commonly used.

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,199
So most of the time you're going to be using solid state drive options, which are all of these here

27
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,160
on the screen.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,860
Newer options are the GP free, the IO two and the IO two BLOCK Express.

29
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,470
And of course you can read all about the different features and limitations and performance characteristics

30
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,300
on this page here and us have lots more information on their website.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,000
A couple of features to point out at the bottom of the table here we can see boot volume is supported

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,040
for all of these different types.

33
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,440
So that means that any of these volume types can be used as a boot volume where your operating system

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,080
is installed for your EC2 instance.

35
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:50,810
EBS multi attach where we attach one EBS volume to multiple instances is not supported except for on

36
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,100
the right hand side here.

37
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,280
And of course we have the performance characteristics here.

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:03,650
So we have the volume size ranging up to 16 TB bytes for general purpose and then up to 64 here for

39
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,140
the BLOCK Express, IOPS is one of the performance characteristics of the volume.

40
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:17,480
So here where it says Max IOPS 16,000, that stands for having up to 16,000 input output operations

41
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,440
per second.

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,890
And we can see the BLOCK Express has a huge number of IOPS.

43
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,620
They're very high performance and of course you will pay for that.

44
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,900
And throughput is essentially the measurement of how much data can be read and written to the disk.

45
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,080
And we can see that for the different volume types here as well.

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,680
I mentioned before that there's two different volume types that we're going to discuss.

47
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,100
We've got the EBS volume and then we have the instance store.

48
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,020
So what is an instance store?

49
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,950
Well, in this diagram you can see we have the easy to host server.

50
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:53,120
So remember that your AC two instances are running on a physical server in the data center at us.

51
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,980
Now our EBS volumes are attached over a network instance.

52
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,970
Store volumes.

53
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:04,370
Are these ones here within the host server, They're actually physically attached to the host and they

54
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,400
offer extremely high performance, whereas the EBS volumes are actually attached over the network.

55
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,900
So what else is different?

56
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,600
Well, instant store volumes are ephemeral.

57
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,160
That means non persistent.

58
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,500
And what non persistent means is your data is lost if you terminate your instance.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,850
So if you launch an instance with an instance store volume, the data on the instance store volume is

60
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,370
only accessible for the lifetime of that instance.

61
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,800
You can't actually stop an AC two instance that has an attached instance or volume.

62
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,830
You can restart it and you won't lose your data.

63
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,400
But if you terminate your instance, there's no way to keep that data.

64
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,490
Whereas with an EBS volume, the volume exists independently of the issue instance.

65
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:55,490
So you can terminate your instance and you can keep your volume and then reattach it to another instance

66
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,660
to read that data.

67
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:05,810
EBS volumes are persistent, so that means the data is kept there, it's not deleted and it exists independently

68
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,070
of the instance.

69
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,780
So why might you use instance store volumes?

70
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,080
Well, they offer extremely high performance and they come with some instance types.

71
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,470
So the storage is available and it can be used for things like data that's only temporary.

72
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,260
For instance, it can be used as a scratch volume.

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,350
That's where data is getting stored for a temporary basis.

74
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,040
It's used, but it doesn't need to be kept and retained or backed up.

75
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:37,070
In another use case, you might have some data that requires high performance and it's replicated to

76
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,240
other instances, so you always have multiple copies of the data.

77
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,270
So how do we back up our EBS volumes?

78
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,330
Well, we can back them up using something called a snapshot.

79
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,870
So we have an AC two instance here in an availability zone.

80
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:59,030
It has an attached volume, a snapshot can be taken and it captures a point in time state of the data

81
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,920
that's actually in that volume.

82
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:09,260
So that data can then be created as a snapshot and it's actually created in Amazon S3 So it's outside

83
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,760
of the availability zone.

84
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,310
Then we can take additional snapshots and each snapshot is incremental.

85
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:23,450
So it captures the changes since the previous snapshot because our snapshots live in Amazon is free,

86
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,090
which is outside of the availability zone.

87
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,820
We can also use our snapshot to create volumes in different availability zones.

88
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:39,410
So here we've created an EBS volume in availability Zone B from the snapshot, and then we can attach

89
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:45,980
that volume to an easy to instance in availability zone B So we've been able to essentially move that

90
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,440
data between availability zones.

91
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:55,520
You can also create images, the Amazon machine images from our snapshots, and they can be used then

92
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,930
to create instances in different availability zones.
