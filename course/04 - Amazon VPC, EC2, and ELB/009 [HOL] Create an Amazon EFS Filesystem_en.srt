00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,960
Welcome to another hands on lesson.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,500
In this lesson, we're going to create an Amazon FS file system and mount it to two instances across

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,330
two availability zones.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,440
Now remember that the FS file systems are mounted to Linux instances and we'll need to run some commands

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,280
on Linux.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,940
The first one here is where we make a mount point.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,580
This is a directory on the Linux instance to which we will mount the file system.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,120
Then there's a couple of ways that we can install the utilities we need and mount the file system.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,950
The first is using the standard NFS client and for that we would install the NFS utils and then run

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,850
this command.

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:56,040
Now this command specifies the file system some parameters and then in red here we can see the DNS name

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,490
for the file system and it gets mounted to the mount point.

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:05,790
That means that if you write some files to this location, you will see those written to the FS file

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,450
system.

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,140
Now, the other way, and what we're going to do is to use the AWS fs utils for that.

16
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,350
We install the Amazon FS utils package and then we use the Mount Helper command to actually mount the

17
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,190
file system.

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,790
And that's what we're going to do when we're ready to mount our file system.

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,560
So let's head over to the console.

20
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,470
I'm in the easy to management console and first what we're going to do is create a security group and

21
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:39,120
then our instances I'm going to click on Create Security group call this one FS access and add the same

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,290
into the description.

23
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,070
It can stay in the default VPC for inbound rules.

24
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:50,070
We'll need to manage our instances using SSH, and I'll need to allow that from anywhere.

25
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:56,340
Now I do need to add another rule for FS, but at this point I won't be able to do it the way I want

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,490
to.

27
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,540
I'll show you what I mean.

28
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,960
If I type NFS before the network file system, we get the port range specified.

29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,560
But what I want to do is I want to secure it to the security group itself and I can't see the security

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,340
group when I type.

31
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,120
SG.

32
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:19,020
I can see other security groups in here, but I can't see the ID of this security group, so I can't

33
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,680
do that one yet.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,950
What I have to do is create the security group.

35
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,720
Then we're going to run.

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:33,270
EDIT inbound rules, add a new inbound rule again, Type NFS protocol is correct, and then let's type

37
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,090
SG This time we can see the group.

38
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,760
This security group will be attached to our instances, but it will also be attached to the file system.

39
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,410
And this rule we've just added will allow inbound traffic on the NFS port from the instances that have

40
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,210
this security group attached.

41
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,920
So let's click on Save Rules.

42
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,000
That one's done.

43
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,050
Let's go to instances and it's launched two instances.

44
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:06,240
Now what I'm going to do is use the Linux to Amy so defaults there t to micro don't need a key pair.

45
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,170
That's fine.

46
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,780
We're going to select an existing security group, we're going to choose FS access.

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,070
And the only other thing I want to do is click on, edit and select my subnet.

48
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,750
This one will go into USSD one A and that's basically it.

49
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,550
Let's just launch that instance.

50
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:31,920
Then we're going to go back, launch a second instance, and it will have the same settings except it's

51
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:40,590
going to be in US East one B So let's add the security group, come in to subnets and there's one B

52
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,070
there.

53
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,410
Okay, So they're in different subnets.

54
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,750
And that's it.

55
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,400
The instances are launching.

56
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,240
Great.

57
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,590
So let's go over to FS and create our file system.

58
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,270
So I'm going to search for FS.

59
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,370
Open it up in a new tab.

60
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:02,630
And this is the console page for FS and all we need to do here is simply create a file system.

61
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,880
We can optionally give it a name, I just call it my FS file system.

62
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,760
We'll leave it in the default VPC the same as our instances and we'll leave the standard storage class,

63
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,760
selected it and we'll just create our file system.

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,860
There are more options if you want to customize the performance and other characteristics, but we'll

65
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,670
just create.

66
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,490
All right.

67
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,030
So that is being created and that will take a couple of minutes.

68
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:38,030
Now, if we click on the file system and we come in here and then go to network, what you'll see is

69
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:44,030
that it's creating these mount targets in all of these different availability zones.

70
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,730
But there's also a DNS name here.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,030
Now we're going to copy that DNS name and use it for our commands.

72
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,330
So I have this document open.

73
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,500
This is in the course download, which you find at the end of section one of the course.

74
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:05,180
Unzip the file and then in the code Amazon FS directory you'll find this document called Amazon FS commands

75
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,020
MD.

76
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,120
What I need to do is delete out this DNS name here.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,690
So we should be left with just this colon and a slash and then paste in the correct one.

78
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,790
So now I have the correct ID for my file system.

79
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,780
So make sure your document looks like this.

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,510
We'll be using this shortly.

81
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,080
Now we're going to run these commands in order, so I'll copy the first one.

82
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,800
Let's go to EC two.

83
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,820
I'm going to refresh the page, so I've got my two instances and I'm going to open easy, to instance,

84
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,990
connect for each of these instances.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,130
So just open up instance, connect for each one and we're going to run the same commands on each instance.

86
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,120
Okay, so let's paste in this command here.

87
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,570
This is going to run the update manager.

88
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,510
Do the same for the second instance.

89
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,370
While that's happening, I'm going to go and get the other command.

90
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,800
Let's come back to the first instance.

91
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,830
There was nothing to update, which is good.

92
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,450
Let's just make that directory that's been done and do the same for the second instance.

93
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,630
Then we're going to install the fs utils.

94
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:21,230
So let's copy this command, go back to my first instance, paste the command that's installing very

95
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,500
quickly, do the same for the second instance.

96
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
So we're ready to mount now, but we need to do a couple of things first.

97
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,110
So let's go back to FS.

98
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,550
Let's refresh the page.

99
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,230
Now you can see that the security group is default and we don't want that.

100
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,770
We want to click on Manage because we have our own security group.

101
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,360
This one is not going to work.

102
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:48,380
Now our instances are in UX, one, A and B, So for ease, let's remove these other points.

103
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,280
We don't need them.

104
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,630
I'll get rid of the default security group and then I'm going to add in FS access to each of these.

105
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:05,120
So now we've enabled the mount points only in the US s1a and one B availability zones and we have a

106
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:13,250
security group attached and that security group will allow inbound access on the NFS port from the instances

107
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,350
because they are in the security group.

108
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,860
All right, let's go down and we're going to save this.

109
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,760
And we now have the DNS name in our command.

110
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,520
So we should be able to mount this file system.

111
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:32,450
So back in the document, I'm going to copy the entire Mount Command and I've already updated my DNS

112
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,130
name, so it is correct.

113
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,300
Let's come back to our first instance here and I'm going to clear the screen and bring this down so

114
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,620
you can see what's going on.

115
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,210
Let's click on Mount.

116
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,470
And that's done.

117
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,920
So the fact that we don't get an error message is good news.

118
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,300
I'll do the same here.

119
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,680
Let's run this command.

120
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,900
And again, we've mounted the file system.

121
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:59,150
So we should be able to change directory to the FS mount point now and then create data there and we

122
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,240
should be able to see that data from the other instance.

123
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,920
So we have our file system mounted.

124
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:12,470
Now if I change directory to the mount point, which should be in my current folder so I can change

125
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,620
directory to FS, Mount Point and then run LHS.

126
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,420
Of course there's nothing in there.

127
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:25,310
So what I'm going to do is run sudo make directory test directory and now we have a directory and I

128
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:31,970
could run sudo touch test file and then I have a file as well.

129
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:32,640
Okay.

130
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,700
So that's all I'm going to do.

131
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,669
Just add a couple of things and hopefully when we mount the directory from the instance in the alpha

132
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,289
availability zone, it should see the same information.

133
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,770
So back on my second instance, I'm going to change directory to the FS Mount Point run LS and of course

134
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,940
there are my files.

135
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,740
So that's it.

136
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:57,170
We have launched two instances and attach them to an RFS file system and we can read and write data

137
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,100
from multiple availability zones to the same FS file system.

138
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,520
So that's it for this lesson.

139
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:09,350
What I'm going to do is I'm going to go back and I'm going to terminate my two instances.

140
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,650
And then I'm going to also delete my FS file system so the instances are going down.

141
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:25,110
Let's go back to FS, click on file systems, select the file system, choose delete, and then we just

142
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,810
need to enter the idea of the file system, which I can just copy from here and then confirm.

143
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,290
And that's it.

144
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,050
That should start deleting fairly soon.

145
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,860
Just keep an eye on it.

146
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,880
Make sure it does.

147
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,870
And I will see you in the next lesson.
