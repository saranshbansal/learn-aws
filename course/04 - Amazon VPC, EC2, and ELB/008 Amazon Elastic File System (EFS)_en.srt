Hey, guys, let's look at the Amazon Elastic file system.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,220
Amazon FS.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:17,960
Now, FS is a file based storage system that we can use to attach to our EC2 instances.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,200
So how does it look?

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,700
Well, in FS we create our file system.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,770
We can then attach easy to instances to the file system.

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:33,080
Now, as you can see in this diagram, we have instances in multiple availability zones and they are

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,050
connected to the same file system.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,920
So that means they can read and write data to that file system.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,850
They both see it as a mount point and they can both read and write data and see each other's data.

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:54,980
So FS is a great way to attach a shared storage location to multiple instances in different availability

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,490
zones.

13
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,470
You can't do that with EBS.

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:03,500
Now, as I mentioned in a previous video with the Elastic BLOCK store EBS, you do have the option for

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,820
multi attach, but that's limited to within an availability zone.

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,070
There's a limited number of instances you can connect and they must be built with a certain architecture.

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,990
So there's quite a few constraints.

18
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:21,530
Now with FS you can attach many, many instances across multiple availability zones within a region

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,180
to the same file system.

20
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,610
So it's a really great storage location.

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:33,200
Now it is mounted using an FS mount point, so that means a path in the file system.

22
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,060
Now it is Linux only and it uses the NFS protocol.

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,880
So that's the network file system protocol that's used to access the file system.

24
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:49,700
And because it runs on Linux only, we have mount points rather than drive letters.

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:56,000
So remember with Windows you might have a drive letter like your D, e, F drive, Z drive and so on.

26
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:02,780
In this case, because it's Linux, you have a mount point and that is just a location in the file system

27
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,830
of the instance.

28
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:10,520
If you save data to that location in the file system, it actually gets written to FS.

29
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:17,120
You can also connect an on premises client in a corporate data center to an FS file system.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,270
And in that case you would want to connect a direct connect connection or at the very least a VPN.
