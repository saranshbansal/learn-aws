1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,850
In this lesson, I'm going to launch an Auto Scaling web application on Amazon EC2.

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,160
I'm in the EC2 management console.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,460
And the first thing I need to do is create a launch template.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,860
So the launch template is going to specify some information about how to

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,860
configure the EC2 instances that are launched by the Auto Scaling group.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,720
So I'm going to click create launch template.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,460
We're going to give it a name.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,060
I'm going to call it my EC2 web app.

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,330
And then I don't need to give it a version description at this stage.

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,860
Let's just scroll down and specify some information.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,960
So what I'm going to do is click on the quick start.

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,483
I'm going to choose Amazon Linux.

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,450
The Amazon Linux 2 AMI is selected and that's fine.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,780
We're going to leave this information as it is.

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,150
For instance type I want to specify to use the T2 micro instance type.

16
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,800
For key pair, I'm going to select the key pair that I already have in my region

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,450
so MyNV-KP.

18
00:01:08,726 --> 00:01:09,920
If you don't have a key pair,

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,740
just go back to the EC2 management console and create a key pair.

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,960
Under network settings, I want to select an existing security group.

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,020
I'm going to choose the web access security group which is in my VPC.

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,590
Under advanced network configuration,

23
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:30,260
all I want to do here is change the auto assign public IP to enable.

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,070
Then let's scroll down.

25
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,160
The storage can be left as it is. I don't need to change anything there.

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,950
In advanced details at the bottom,

27
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,760
the only thing I want to do is scroll all the way down

28
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,700
and enter some user data.

29
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,170
Now, in the course download which you can find at the end of section one,

30
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:55,660
you'll have the code directory, EC2, and then this file EC2-user-data-web-app.shh.

31
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,460
And all we need to do is copy all of this information to our clipboard.

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,260
This will simply install HTTPD, sort of create an Apache web server.

33
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,669
It's then going to use the instance, metadata service

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,410
to find the name of the availability zone into which this instance is launched.

35
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,580
And then it's going to add that to the index.html.

36
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,051
So what we'll see when we go to the website is it will say

37
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:30,380
this amazon EC2 instance is located in availability zone and then the name of the AZ.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,250
So back in the console we simply paste in our user data

39
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,170
and create our launch template.

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,350
So that's done. So now we can go back up to EC2,

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,150
come down to the bottom,

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,730
select Auto Scaling groups.

43
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,850
We're going to create an Auto Scaling group. This one is going to be called ASG1.

44
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,360
I'm going to find my launch template, scroll down, click on next, choose my VPC.

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,570
So remember, I did choose a specific security group that's in this VPC.

46
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,708
So I need to make sure that the security group

47
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:07,860
specified in the launch template matches the VPC.

48
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,350
So I've selected my VPC.

49
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,880
And then I'm going to choose the public subnets, public-1A and public-1B.

50
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,650
If I come down a little further, I can just select next again.

51
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,470
I don't have a load balancer at this stage

52
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,780
and I don't need to modify any settings. So let's click on next.

53
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,816
Now for desired minimum and max capacity, for now, I'm going to leave it on one.

54
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:33,660
And I'm not going to use a scaling policy at this point in time.

55
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,060
So let's click on next.

56
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,190
Next again. Next again.

57
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,590
We get the summary of information and then we can create our Auto Scaling group.

58
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,660
So that should launch a single EC2 instance.

59
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,190
And once that instance is launched, we should be able to go

60
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:53,856
to the public DNS or the public IP of that instance and we should see a web page.

61
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:59,760
Now, make sure that your security group does have a rule for HTTP.

62
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,360
So I'm going to go to my web access security group.

63
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,180
Under inbound rules, let's just have a look.

64
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,260
I only have RDP and SSH. So it's not going to work. So I need to edit inbound rules,

65
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,850
add rule, and then I'm simply going to choose HTTP.

66
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,649
Under source, I'm going to say anywhere IPv4.

67
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,610
And then save rules.

68
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,860
So now my rules are configured correctly.

69
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,410
Now if we go back to Auto Scaling groups,

70
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,950
select the group

71
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,860
got activity,

72
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,090
and here you can see some of the activity that's happening and

73
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,890
at the moment it's launching a new EC2 instance.

74
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,490
So if we go up to instances,

75
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,130
we can see that this instance is running.

76
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,790
Now, these two were terminated there from a previous exercise.

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,020
This is the one that is just being initialized by the Auto Scaling group.

78
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,850
So in a couple of minutes we should be able

79
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,650
to connect to the website running on our instance.

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,050
With the instance selected, I can now see lots of information about the incidents

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,070
including the public IP.

82
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,100
So I'm going to select to copy the public IP to my clipboard.

83
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:07,310
Alternatively you can use the DNS.

84
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,420
And in a new tab I'm going to enter

85
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,440
and we can see that there is a website running on this instance

86
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,010
and it's telling us the availability zone that the instance is running in.

87
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,060
So that's exactly as expected.

88
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,560
Now back in the console, what I'm going to do is just go down to Auto Scaling groups,

89
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,660
go into ASG1, and I'm going to click on edit next to group details.

90
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,550
And I'm going to change the desired capacity to two

91
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,160
and the maximum to three.

92
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,770
So that should launch another EC2 instance.

93
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,270
If I click on update, it's going to save those changes.

94
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,270
Now another thing you can do is use dynamic or predictive

95
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:55,805
scaling policies to scale based on whether it's something dynamic such as

96
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:01,318
the CPU utilization or predictive where it's going to scale because it knows

97
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:05,550
when certain activity is going to happen like an increase in traffic.

98
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,550
With dynamic, you have some options. You've got target tracking where it tries to

99
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,170
keep the certain metric at a specific value.

100
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:21,230
So for example you can say keep the CPU utilization around 50% aggregated across

101
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,150
the instances in the Auto Scaling group.

102
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,350
Or you can choose step

103
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,000
where you can have different reactions to different levels of change.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,210
So if you have a small increase in traffic you launch one instance if you have a larger

105
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,860
increase in traffic then you launch a few instances at a time.

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,500
Or otherwise there's simple scaling where you simply add a certain

107
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,860
number of capacity units or percent of the group

108
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,250
when it's needed, so based on a specific alarm in CloudWatch.

109
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,251
So we're not going to do that. Let's just go back to details.

110
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:00,060
In fact let's go to activity.

111
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,230
And we can see that a new instance is being launched.

112
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,820
So that should now be launched in the console.

113
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,930
Let's just refresh EC2. Now, we have two running instances.

114
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,150
And that's it for this hands-on lesson.

115
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,600
Please leave your Auto Scaling group running as we're going to be launching an

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,560
Application Load Balancer in another hands on lesson

117
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,590
and attaching it to our ASG.
