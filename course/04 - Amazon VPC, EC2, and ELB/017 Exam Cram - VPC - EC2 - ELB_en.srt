00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,590
Hi guys and welcome to the first exam cram of the course.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,550
So there's lots of exam crowns, they're not in every section,

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,180
but they are in many sections of the course.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,120
Now the exam crowns are a very quick walkthrough of some

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,630
key facts that are important to know for the exam.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,310
They're not a substitute for doing the lessons,

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,700
There are some facts that won't be covered in the exam

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,420
crams and there might be some additional ones that are.

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,960
So the idea is that you use both the lessons

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,630
in the section as well as the exam cram and exam cram will

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,780
just give you a fast way to get to some core facts.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,300
This exam cram is about amazon VPc, easy to and elastic load balancing.

13
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,660
So let's get started.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,260
So VPC is a logically isolated portion of the cloud within a region.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,360
The VPc router will take care of routing within the VPc and outside of the VPc.

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,010
And the route table is used to configure the VPc router,

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,480
an internet gateway is attached to a VPC

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,050
and that's used to connect to the internet

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,970
and the VPc will span all the availability zones

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,050
in the region.

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,160
Each VPC has a different block of IP addresses and that's known as a cider block.

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,030
Subnets are created within availability zones

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,930
and each sub net has a block of I P addresses from the overall cider block.

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,740
Security groups are applied at the instance level,

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,050
specifically at the elastic network interface level.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,840
Security groups can be applied to instances in any sub net.

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,290
They're also used for allow rules only. You can't create a deny rule.

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,510
Separate rules are defined for outbound traffic versus inbound traffic.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,240
And a source

30
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,350
in a rule can be an iP address or a security group ID.

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,260
Nichols apply at the sub net level

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,130
nickels which are network access control lists apply only to traffic entering and

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,540
exiting the sub net not traffic that's

34
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,070
crossing between instances within the subnets.

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,560
Rules are processed in order and they're numbered

36
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,150
and Nichols will have an explicit deny at the end.

37
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,690
An Ec two instance is a virtual server running in the cloud.

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,640
The ec two instances can run Windows, Lennox or mac. Os

39
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,250
and the hosts that they run upon are managed by AWS

40
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,920
an amazon machine image and am I defines the configuration of the instance

41
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,960
and you can customize your instance and create a custom am I?

42
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,140
A snapshot is a point in time backup of an instance.

43
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,860
User data is code that's run when the instance starts for the first time. Only

44
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,840
instance metadata

45
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,710
is data about your easy to instance

46
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:56,380
and you can find the instance metadata using this U. R. L. So take note of this. U R. L.

47
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,760
It is worth understanding.

48
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,970
Access keys are composed of the access key ID and a secret access key

49
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,360
and you can use them to sign programmatic requests to the Cli or the A P. I.

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,460
It's a best practice to use temporary security credentials.

51
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,160
I am rolls That is instead of using access keys whenever possible.

52
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,110
Also you should disable any AWS account root user access keys.

53
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,190
The access key

54
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,750
is associated with an I am account.

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,760
The access key will use the permissions assigned to the I AM user

56
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,360
I am roles should be used instead of access keys wherever you can.

57
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,650
Elastic load balancers provide a single endpoint for your application,

58
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,920
lbs distribute connections to back end instances,

59
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,260
addresses, containers and functions.

60
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,560
Target groups are used for attaching the target applications to the E L. B.

61
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,600
The application load balancer. The A. L. B.

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,180
Is used for web applications with layer seven routing,

63
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,460
that's http and https protocols and also advanced request routing as well.

64
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,590
The NLB the network load balancer is used for TCP and

65
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,290
UDP based applications and offers ultra low latency static I.

66
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,450
P addresses and VPc endpoint services.

67
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,830
The G L B, which is the gateway load balancer distributes connections to appliances

68
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,280
like I. DS systems, I P. S.

69
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,060
Next generation firewalls and web application firewalls.

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,800
Session state data can be stored in databases such as dynamodb and elastic cache.

71
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,730
This type of data can include temporary data,

72
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,450
metadata authentication information and more

73
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,040
sticky sessions can be used on lbs to bind a session to an easy to instance

74
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,610
sticky sessions uses cookies

75
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,260
that get generated at the MLB level.

76
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,050
You can use a combination of duration based stickiness,

77
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,450
application based stickiness and no stickiness across your target groups,

78
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,220
sticky sessions are not supported with TLS listeners

79
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,780
and TLS target groups when you're using an NLB

80
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,830
and that's it for this exam, cram.

81
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,150
Hope that was useful and I'll see you in the next lesson.
