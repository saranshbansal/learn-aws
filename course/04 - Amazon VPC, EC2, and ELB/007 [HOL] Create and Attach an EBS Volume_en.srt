1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,530
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to create and attach EBS volumes in the AC two management

2
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:12,250
console.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,740
I'm going to go to launch templates and use the launch template we created earlier, and that makes

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,080
it a bit easier to launch my instance.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,630
So I'm going to launch instance from template.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,560
Now I do need to change a couple of things.

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:33,040
I need to select the option, proceed without a keeper and I need to select a subnet and I'm going to

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,980
choose Public one A and that has to be in the same VPC as our security group, which in this case it

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,460
is.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,580
So now I should be able to launch my instance.

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,540
Great.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,470
That's launching.

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,760
So while my instance is launching, let's just refresh here so we can see it.

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,740
We are going to go down to EBS and the volumes pane here.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,050
Choose volumes.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,600
Now you can see that we already have a volume and that is the route volume for the instance that we

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,350
just launched.

18
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,810
And you can see that it's in use.

19
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,070
So what we're going to do is create a extra volume.

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,910
So we choose create volume.

21
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,180
Now we get to choose the volume type.

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:22,940
So we could choose GP to GP free IO one, IO two or the older hard disk drives, the C one or RST one

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,730
or even the magnetic, which has been around a long time.

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:32,930
Now if we choose something like the IO one, you get to configure the performance characteristics such

25
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,030
as the input output per second.

26
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,990
The IOPS.

27
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,190
You get to specify the size, of course, as well.

28
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,580
Now, what we'll do is we'll keep things a bit cheaper.

29
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:49,930
We'll go to GP two and we'll keep the 100 gigabytes and it tells us the fixed performance that we can

30
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,330
get for this particular volume.

31
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,140
Now which availability zone should we put it in?

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,670
Well, we just selected us East one A for instance.

33
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,320
That means this volume needs to be in US East one, eh?

34
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,350
Because otherwise the instance won't be able to use it.

35
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,160
So we do need to use the US one a availability zone.

36
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:20,910
Now you can optionally encrypt the volume and you can choose to use the default key from us.

37
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,820
And that will encrypt the volume and all the data that's stored on it.

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,220
I'm not going to select this option for now.

39
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,230
Let's choose create volume.

40
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,570
So the volume is now in the creating state, and it shouldn't take very long before it's ready.

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,240
Okay, so the volume is now available.

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,090
If I select the volume going to actions, we can then attach the volume.

43
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,850
So note that you can also modify in here.

44
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:52,960
So if you needed to change the volume type or the size of the volume or obviously you could change the

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,690
performance characteristics of IO one as well.

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,420
But we'll keep it on GP too.

47
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,720
I'm not going to modify it.

48
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,130
All I want to do is attach it to my EC2 instance.

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,160
So now I'm going to attach the volume and I should be able to find my instance nice and easily.

50
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:16,420
It's going to decide the device name to use and we can click on attach volume and that's it.

51
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,620
That's all there is to it.

52
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:24,160
We've now attached an additional volume to our instance that we could then partition and format and

53
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,820
use.

54
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,110
Now, what will happen to this volume if we terminate our instance?

55
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:36,610
Well, the root volume by default will be deleted when you terminate your instance, but any extra volumes

56
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,270
that you add will by default still remain in your account.

57
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,200
So if we terminate the instance, we should find that this extra volume remains behind.

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,910
So let's test that out.

59
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,820
Let's go back to instances and I'm going to terminate my ESI two instance.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,640
And if we come back to volumes.

61
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:05,680
What we should see shortly is that that volume will be removed and the additional volume will remain

62
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,240
and it will be available for us to attach to another EC2 instance.

63
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,660
So there we go.

64
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,910
That didn't take long.

65
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:21,089
The root volume was deleted and the extra volume is now available for us to use and attach to another

66
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,410
AC two instance.

67
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,820
So EBS is persistent storage and you can keep that data long term and move your volumes between instances

68
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,630
if you need to.

69
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,390
That's it for this lesson.

70
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,680
I will see you in the next one.
