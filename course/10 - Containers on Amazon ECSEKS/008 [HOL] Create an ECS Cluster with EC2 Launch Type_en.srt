00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,970
Hi guys and welcome to this lesson.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,530
So this lesson is going to be a hands on with amazon Ec s.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,780
What we're going to do is we're going to create

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,780
a cluster that uses the Ec two launch type.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,670
So we're gonna have instances in our account.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,360
Ec two instances that are configured as part of the cluster.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,780
And then we're gonna run our tasks on top of the cluster.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,860
Now in this particular lesson we'll create the cluster,

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,130
will launch the instances and configure them so that they added into the cluster.

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,430
And then in the next lesson, what we'll do is we're going to start launching tasks,

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,180
will create a task definition,

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,560
launch a task and then we're gonna launch a service with a load balancer as well.

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,210
So it should be a great couple of labs, let's head over to the console.

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,090
So I'm logged into the console and what I need to do is create a role and this role is

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:01,140
going to be used by our ec two instances in order to be able to speak to e C S.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,860
So we need to provide the permissions to E C S.

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,030
So we're gonna create a role.

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,870
Now, what I'm gonna do is use EC two as the common use case.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,180
If you look at the AWS documentation,

20
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,770
they ask you to choose the elastic container service.

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,220
It actually adds a very similar policy but I found it didn't work recently.

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,460
There's a lot of nuances with pcs at the moment.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,860
So what I want to do here is choose ec two

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,260
click on next

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,360
and I'm just going to paste in

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,960
amazon ec two container service for ec two role.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,740
So you can just type that in or type part of it in and you'll see a number of options.

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,250
Just make sure you select the one with the exact name, you can see on your screen here.

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,770
And if you expand that to look at the permissions, you can see

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,540
there's some Ec two

31
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,540
permissions and lots of CCs and ec our permissions

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,560
and then cloudwatch logs as well.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,160
So I'm gonna select this policy,

34
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,560
click on next, we're going to give it a name.

35
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,640
Mine's gonna be e C s instance role

36
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,270
and we can see that the trusted entity is easy to

37
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,160
so easy to instances will be able to assume this role

38
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,960
and they'll have the permissions to e C s.

39
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,220
So let's create the role. We now have our role.

40
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,560
The next thing to do is go to Pcs and we're gonna create our cluster

41
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,350
Now. I'm using the new E C s experience.

42
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,250
They've actually been working on this for I think over a year now.

43
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,100
It's taken a really long time. Most of the updates to the console.

44
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,680
The major updates were completed quite a while ago.

45
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,060
This one is ongoing

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,280
and I've been quite patient because I've been waiting for them to get to a point

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,370
where I can actually record the entire labs

48
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,860
without switching between the old and the new.

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,770
Now at this point in time, I can do pretty much everything,

50
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,010
in fact everything that we are going to do in these labs, I can do in the new console.

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,390
Sometimes you do get flicked to the

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,450
old console for instance when you're updating clusters

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,520
and there's quite a few nuances,

54
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,410
a few weird things that you've got to watch out for when

55
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,060
using UCS and I'll point those out as we go through.

56
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,480
So I'm gonna click on clusters

57
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,630
so I'm gonna click create cluster,

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,950
I'm gonna give it a name, I'm gonna call it my

59
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,250
e c s dash cluster

60
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,440
for vPc networking,

61
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,350
we're in the US east one north Virginia region and we have the default VPc selected.

62
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,380
I'm happy with that.

63
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,930
And there's six subnets and I'm happy to use all of those that all public subnets

64
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,770
for infrastructure. Fargate the serverless option is selected by default.

65
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,460
You can't deselect it either

66
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,070
if you wanted to use this configuration easy to instances.

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,060
This is where it will actually create an

68
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,700
auto scaling group for your instances for you

69
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,600
and it does a bit more configuration.

70
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,190
Now, what I want to do for this particular exercises, show you how to do it manually

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,160
and we're going to use external instances using E c s anywhere.

72
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,110
Now we're not really using easy. S anywhere, but this is the option we need.

73
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,260
So E c s anywhere would allow you to run your containers managed by AWS outside of AWS.

74
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,490
So we've got that one selected

75
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,110
and I'm going to click on create

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,790
and that should just take a moment and then we'll have our cluster ready.

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,850
So my cluster is ready. That's all worked.

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,740
Next thing to do is to go to the Ec two management console and what we want

79
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:26,460
to do now is actually run our Ec two instances which are going to be the container host

80
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,730
Now we do need to use a specific am I that's optimized for E C.

81
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,150
S and has the agent installed on it.

82
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,570
Now, the best thing to do is to follow this link,

83
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,160
I've provided the link in the attached to the lesson.

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,660
So when you go to this link you can scroll down a little way

85
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:51,290
and you'll see that there's a link to get the am I am I I D for your particular region.

86
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,150
So if I click on view, am I I D.

87
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,450
That takes me to this page and you can see there's a value here

88
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,840
am I dash and then a big long

89
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,860
combination of letters and numbers, just copy that value.

90
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,560
Let's come back to ec. two

91
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,750
click on launch instance,

92
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,460
you can give them a name if you like. So for instance e CS

93
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,370
dash instances

94
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,030
and then here what we want to do

95
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,050
is in the search bar, I'm going to put the am I I D.

96
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,600
It's going to take us over here.

97
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,760
Just takes a second and we can see that it's come up with the E C s optimist am I?

98
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,520
So we can select this instance,

99
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,660
click on, continue

100
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,610
now it does then default the instance type to an M five dot large.

101
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,980
We don't need to do that. We can keep this in the free tier.

102
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,830
So I'm just going to find the T two micro

103
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,950
instance type

104
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,560
to keep a I'm going to select my key pair for this region

105
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,220
for security group. I'll let it create a new one

106
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,370
and that will allow ssh it doesn't allow anything else.

107
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,330
We'll need to make sure our containers do have the right

108
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,580
security groups to allow access to the application

109
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,260
but that's fine for the host.

110
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,650
So then I can come down everything there looks normal.

111
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,050
Let's expand advanced details.

112
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,770
And here we want to change the instance profile.

113
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,870
We want to select the e c s instance role.

114
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,860
So now we have the correct permissions

115
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,080
and finally under user data we need to enter some user data

116
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,960
to configure the cluster.

117
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,590
So in the course download, you will find yours will be in the code directory

118
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,990
amazon ec. S and then you'll find this file easy to cluster instances dot M d.

119
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,520
Now what you need to do,

120
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,620
just in case you changed your cluster name to something different.

121
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,360
Just enter your cluster name here. So it should

122
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,440
echo

123
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,850
underscore cluster equals. And then the cluster name

124
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,550
and that's going to be saved into this file.

125
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,960
The e c s dot conflict file.

126
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,060
So mine is set up correctly. I'm gonna copy that code

127
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,950
and then back in the console just paste that into the user data.

128
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,360
So that's going to configure

129
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,280
the cluster name.

130
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,540
And of course this, am I already has

131
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,790
the E C s agent installed if you just choose another, Am I?

132
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,660
It might not have the E C s agent installed, so you must

133
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,760
use an AM I that does have it installed or install it manually.

134
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,760
So in this case we've got the permissions

135
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,960
and we have our cluster name correctly configured,

136
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,160
so I'm just gonna launch this instance.

137
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,710
So our instance is being launched,

138
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,260
we can now go back to e c s,

139
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,660
choose my e c s cluster,

140
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,700
go to infrastructure

141
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,790
and in the bottom here

142
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,330
under contained instances very shortly. We should see our instance.

143
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,740
So you'll need to give it a minute or so and then click on refresh.

144
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,130
So mine has been refreshed and I can see now that I have my container instance,

145
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,030
type Ec two, you can see the instance I D we can see the availability zone

146
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,470
and of course we don't have any running tasks.

147
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,070
Now we don't have a huge amount of CPU and memory available because we

148
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,060
chose the T two micro so we won't be able to run many containers

149
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,260
on this house but that's okay for demonstration purposes.

150
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,030
So that's it we have our cluster created,

151
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,980
we have our instance added and we're gonna finish this lesson in the next lesson.

152
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,060
We're then going to actually launch some containers on top of our host.
