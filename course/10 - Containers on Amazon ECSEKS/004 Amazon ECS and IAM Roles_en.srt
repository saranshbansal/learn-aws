Hi, guys. In this lesson, we're going to go over how you assign permissions to your container instances

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,880
and your actual containers, your tasks themselves.

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,510
So let's have a look at how we use IAM roles with ECS.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,320
So, in this example, we have the EC2 launch type.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,300
So, we have an ECS cluster,

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,380
we have a service, and we have a container instance that we manage.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,000
The container instance has an IAM role assigned to it.

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,410
This is known as the IAM instance role.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,240
This provides the container instance with permissions that it needs.

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:44,210
So, for example, the permissions policy for the container instance role may be like this, where it

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,580
has some EC2 and ECS permissions. And these are permissions assigned to the host.

12
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:56,690
We then have the tasks that are running on our container instance, and those tasks will have an IAM

13
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,740
task role.

14
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,440
So, the role assigned to the task is a different role than the container instance.

15
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:10,220
The permissions assigned to this role are supplied to the container instance, not to the host.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,300
Now, a really important point for the exam is that the permissions assigned to the instance role are

17
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,220
also supplied to the tasks that are running on top of that instance.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,070
So, you want to be very careful what permissions you apply there because your container instances are

19
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,850
going to run them.

20
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:35,600
If you have different containers that should have different permissions, then you should use IAM task

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,050
roles.

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,090
Now, what about on Fargate?

23
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,860
Fargate is a bit simpler.

24
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,260
You only have the IAM task roles.

25
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,740
There's no such thing as a container instance role because you don't have any actual operational control

26
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,570
over the container instances.

27
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:58,010
Now, the task roles are defined in the task definition or in the run task API.

28
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,800
So when we run a task, we can define the role that we want to assign to it, or we assign it through

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,940
the task definition.

30
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,460
And that's where if you have multiple applications running in containers and they come from different

31
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:16,760
task definitions, then you can have different roles for those different applications specified in that

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,780
task definition.

33
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,810
And that's how you will use the principle of least privilege and only assign the permissions that that

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,430
particular application needs.
