Hello and welcome to this section.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:08,160
In this section, I'm going to cover two main services. One is AWS cloudformation,

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,060
that is a service that's used for deploying infrastructure through code.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,390
So we define our infrastructure as we want it to be built

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,450
in a template file and cloud formation takes that

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,320
file and uses it to then automate the implementation,

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,680
the creation of those resources.

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:26,640
Now,

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,180
the other service that we're going to look at is elastic

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,160
beanstalk elastic, beanstalk features quite a lot in the developer associate exam

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,180
beanstalk is often referred to as a platform as a service or PAAS solution

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,740
and that's because beanstalk will give you a managed

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,140
environment onto which you can deploy your code.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,940
So it's really great for developers who

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,560
don't want to manage the underlying infrastructure.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,200
That's the low balances and the ec2 instances and even databases

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,150
that are connected to your applications.

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,930
So there's lots of coverage of beanstalk in this course and we'll also

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,030
do quite a few hands on lessons and not just within this section.

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,860
We'll revisit elastic beanstalk later on when we get to the developer tools as well.
