00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,230
Hello and welcome to our AWS Certified Developer Associate course

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,170
in this course along with our practice discourse and our cheat sheets,

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,190
you're going to learn absolutely everything you need to know to pass the exam.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,980
So who is this course for

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,150
this course is for anyone who wants to pass the Developer Associate exam.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,880
Now it doesn't matter if you come from a development background or not.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,480
I will provide all code samples and provide lots of

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,400
instruction to help you deploy infrastructure and code on AWS.

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,430
There'll be lots of hands on lessons

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,960
and lots of theory to back it up. So you really understand the concepts.

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,050
The developer Associate is one of free Associate level exams.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,400
The other two are the Solutions Architect

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,490
Associate and the sys ops Administrator Associate.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,100
I typically recommend that if you're going to work with

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,690
AWS or you're looking to get a job in AWS

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,220
then you should do all free Associate level exams.

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,550
Most people will start with the solutions architect Associate first

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,080
and for that reason I go into more depth on some topics

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,790
in that particular course.

20
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,130
In this course I do start at the basics but then

21
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,320
I move very quickly through to some of the more advanced topics

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,410
that are specific to this exam

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,350
That way I keep the course nice and

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,450
efficient and it's an easier learning experience for you

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,750
in terms of how to use the course.

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,100
I recommend that you follow from the beginning, right the way through to the end,

27
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,780
make sure you create your own free tier account

28
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,580
and follow along with the numerous hands on lessons

29
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,740
That way you get lots of hands on practice which is really

30
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,610
useful for building your knowledge and making sure you remember the concepts.

31
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,020
There's also a free study plan included with the course that gives you a structured

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,940
approach for planning out your training using

33
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,350
the video course and the practice tests.

34
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,740
Now that's it for my quick introduction.

35
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,220
I really hope you enjoy the course and I wish you the best with your exam.

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,950

37
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,360
