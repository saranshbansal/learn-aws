Hi guys. In this lesson, I'm going to cover DynamoDB streams.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,080
So what is streams? Well, let's have a look at an example.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:18,000
So we have an application here, a DynamoDB table and then DynamoDB streams.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,570
Our application is writing items to the table.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,350
Maybe it's inserting, updating, or deleting an item.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,170
So we can see that as the first operation here.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,360
A record is written to the DynamoDB stream.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,360
So after a change is made to the DynamoDB table,

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,660
all changes are then projected into the DynamoDB stream.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,790
We might then have a lambda function being triggered

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,840
and it will do something like process the information

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,560
in the stream and write something to CloudWatch Logs.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,490
So just an example of using a stream.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,960
So streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item level modifications

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,150
in a DynamoDB table.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,280
And the information is stored in a log for up to 24 hours.

17
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,790
Applications can access that log and view the data

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,900
items as they appeared before and after they were modified in near real time.

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,650
You can also use the create table or update

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,760
table API operations to enable or modify a stream.

21
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,800
The stream specification parameter determines how the stream is configured.

22
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,200
So stream enabled specifies that a stream is enabled if it's true or disabled

23
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,090
if it's false.

24
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,680
Stream view type specifies the information that will be written

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,170
to the stream whenever data in the table is modified.

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,650
So what we can do is we can decide what information we want to replicate into streams.

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,750
Either keys only, that means only the key attributes of the modified item.

28
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,500
New image. So the entire item as it appears after it was modified

29
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,520
Old image. The entire item as it appeared before it was modified.

30
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:08,120
Or new and old images and that's both the new and old images of the item.

31
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,660
So this is a great way to record the information that's changed in your table.

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,780
Maybe you want to take the old items so you can archive it in some way.

33
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,920
So you've got a record of the items before they were modified.

34
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,400
Or maybe you want to take the new information and process that outside of DynamoDB

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,290
by using a Lambda function or some other processing element to read from the stream.
