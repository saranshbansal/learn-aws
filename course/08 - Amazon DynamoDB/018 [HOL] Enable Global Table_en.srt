1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,960
In this lesson, we're going to create a global table in a different region

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,300
for the existing table we have in DynamoDB.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,060
So that means we're going to have a

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,920
replicated synchronized copy of our table in another region

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,130
and we'll be able to make changes to the table in either region,

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,460
and those will be synchronized.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,630
So back in DynamoDB, I'm looking at my table which is my store.

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:36,160
And if I go across to global tables, here I can quite simply create a replica.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,240
So what I need to do is choose a different region.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,800
So my current region is US East, so maybe I choose US West.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,150
So now I have a replica of my table in Northern California.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,360
And you can see it's going to use a service-linked role for the replication.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,150
So we don't need to modify anything there. We just create the replica.

14
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,010
Now it says that DynamoDB streams will be

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,630
enabled automatically for new and old images.

16
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,450
So we'll go and have a look at the config of that in a moment.

17
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,980
Now, creation of a global table can take several minutes.

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,490
So don't worry if it takes a little while to synchronize.

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,010
So it's been maybe 15 minutes and my table

20
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,860
is now active and the replication should have completed.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,390
So what I'm gonna do is head over to US West where my other table is.

22
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,360
And we can see that we also have that table active here as well.

23
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,260
So we now have two tables.

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,260
Now, there's lots that you can do if you want to play around and test this out.

25
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,740
So for example, you might want to come in here,

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,550
create new items or add attributes or modify attributes for your existing items

27
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,570
and then watch how it replicates.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,860
So you'll see that it replicates both ways. This is multi-master.

29
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,650
So we can now make changes to the table, both in North California and in US East.

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,040
So I'm finished with this lesson.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,460
So what I'm gonna do is just go back and I'm going to delete my table.

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,750
So what you can do is come back to your table in North Virginia,

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,480
update settings.

34
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:17,860
Under global tables, you can click on your replica and delete the replica.

35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,250
And then once that's deleted you can just go and delete your table as normal.
