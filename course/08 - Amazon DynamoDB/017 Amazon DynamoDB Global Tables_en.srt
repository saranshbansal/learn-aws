Welcome to this lesson. In this lesson, I'm going to cover DynamoDB Global Tables.

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,020
Global tables is a fully managed solution for deploying a multi-region

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,150
and multi-master database.

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,000
When you create a global table,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,570
you specify the regions you want the table to be available in.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,510
And DynamoDB performs all the necessary tasks to create identical tables

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,010
and propagate any ongoing changes to all of those tables.

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,110
And changes can be made in any of those tables

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,260
in any region that your global table is replicated to.

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,680
So let's have a look at a diagram.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,430
We've got region A and region B and also region C here.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,923
We've got DynamoDB and our application server here

13
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:52,850
and it's reading and writing data in the table.

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:00,680
We can then have a replica of the DynamoDB table in each of the other regions as well.

15
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,530
And we can perform read and writes to all of those tables and the

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,410
changes will be replicated across the tables in each of these three regions.

17
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,950
Global tables uses asynchronous replication.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,700
Global tables is therefore a multi-region, multi-master database.

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,060
Each replica table stores the same set of data items.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,200
And you can use logic in the application layer

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,160
to failover to a replica region as well.

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,150
So that gives you really high availability and fault tolerance.
