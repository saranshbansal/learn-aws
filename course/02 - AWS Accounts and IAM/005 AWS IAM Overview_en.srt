Hi, guys. In this lesson, I'm going to give you an overview of the IAM service,

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,235
the Identity and Access Management service.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:20,474
Now, you have seen this in the last section when we logged into AWS and we configured our account.

4
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:23,528
We actually went into the IAM management console.

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,668
IAM is the Identity and Access Management service, and it's a way that we can authenticate and be

6
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:34,475
authorized to access services on AWS.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,876
So let's say we're connecting to an AWS service via either the management console, the Command Line

8
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:43,912
Interface or the API.

9
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:51,230
We'll connect to AWS IAM and we can then authenticate.

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,015
And all principles must be authenticated to send requests.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,376
Now what is a principle?

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:04,718
Well, a principle is a person or an application that can make a request for an action

13
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:07,174
or an operation on a resource.

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:14,748
Now actions and operations are both where we're using the API to interact with an AWS service.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,434
So we have users, roles, federated users, and applications.

16
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,508
We then have a couple of types of policy.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:31,025
So we can assign permissions to users and then we can use policies to control access to resources.

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,157
We have identity-based policies and resource-based policies.

19
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:42,677
And these determine whether to authorize the request, whether to allow or to deny

20
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:44,214
the request to the resource.

21
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,578
And once you've got an allow or a deny, assuming it's a deny in this case, you're then able to run

22
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:53,992
an action against a resource.

23
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,168
Now, remember, I said that everything in AWS is an API call.

24
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:06,970
So when you're trying to launch an EC2 to instance, you're basically executing the RunInstances command.

25
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:14,430
If you're trying to get information about an S3 bucket, you're running the GetBucket API action.

26
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,400
And if you trying to create a user in IAM, you're running the CreateUser action.

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,823
So whatever resource you're interacting with in AWS, an API action is actually being executed

28
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:36,909
and you need to have the permissions assigned to your account and you need to be allowed through a policy

29
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:40,339
to be able to actually perform that specific action.

30
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,793
So the actions are then authorized on the AWS resources.

31
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,048
So that's a really quick overview of what this service does.

32
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:55,880
And in the next lesson, we're going to delve in more depth into users, groups, roles, and policies.
