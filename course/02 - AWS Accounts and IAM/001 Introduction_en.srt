Hi guys and welcome to this section.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,780
In this section we're going to get our AWS account up and running,

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,119
you're going to create a free tier account

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,020
and then perform some configuration on that account.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,370
Make sure you set up multi factor authentication and it's

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,960
also very important to set up a billing alarm.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,620
So we will be launching lots of services in

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,740
this course through the many hands on lessons.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,670
So you'll want to make sure that you've got a billing alarm just in

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,160
case you forget to terminate or delete something that might cost you money.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,190
So the billing alarm can be set at a low value like $5 and you'll get an

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,260
email notifying you that you are starting to run up a little bit of a bill.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,190
You'll also learn about the AWS identity and access management service.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,070
I am and I'm going to teach you about role based

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,830
access control and attribute based access

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,510
control to really important concepts for

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,190
how we can control access to resources and I'll show you

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,850
how to actually assume an I am role using the console.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,550
So I hope you enjoy the lessons. I'll see you in the next one
