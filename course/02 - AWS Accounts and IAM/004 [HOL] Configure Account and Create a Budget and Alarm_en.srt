00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,800
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:12,370
In this lesson, we're going to configure our account and we're going to create a budget and an alarm.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,770
So what are the steps we're going to follow?

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,570
Well, we're going to configure an account alias if we haven't already.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,070
We're going to enable access to billing for IAM users.

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,350
We're going to update our billing preferences and we're going to create a budget and alarm.

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,660
These are really important so that you get notified if you accidentally leave something running and

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,310
you're going to start running up a bill.

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:42,910
I'm logged in to my free tier account and what I'm going to do is in the top left hand corner, use

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,280
this menu, Select services.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,910
Scroll down to security, identity and compliance.

12
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:55,960
In here you will find the IAM Identity and Access Management Service and we're going to use that to

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,970
configure our account alias.

14
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,950
So what is an account alias?

15
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:05,440
Well, it's a name that we can use to sign in instead of using our accounts ID.

16
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,370
So for example, you can see this sign in URL.

17
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:16,420
Once we create user accounts, those users will need to know this URL or at least this account number

18
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,070
in order to be able to sign in.

19
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,110
And that's not really very user friendly.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,430
So what we're going to do, I'm going to give it the same name as my account.

21
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:33,400
I'm going to choose, create type in my preferred alias as Neil Dash a dash and then labs and choose

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,480
save changes.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,490
So it's now created the alias for my account and you can see that in the sign in URL here.

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,150
So now the sign in URL is a little bit easier to remember.

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,150
The next thing we're going to do is we're going to enable billing access for IAM users.

26
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:57,910
What this means is you may remember that I mentioned that we shouldn't sign in as the root user account

27
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,530
on an ongoing basis.

28
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:07,060
It's a best practice to create a user account here in IAM that has the permissions we need to do our

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,250
jobs and log in and start user.

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,980
Now that user won't be able to access billing information which is quite useful when it's your own account.

31
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:21,490
So what we're going to do is choose the account option in the dropdown box in the top right hand corner

32
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:28,180
and if you scroll down this page you will find IAM user and role access to billing information.

33
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,650
Click on edit, click on Activate IAM access.

34
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,660
And then if we supply the permissions to our users, they'll be able to access billing information.

35
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,610
Next, we can choose the dropdown in the top right and choose the billing dashboard.

36
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,680
Here we're going to go to billing preferences on the left hand side.

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,660
And what I like to do here is I like to receive my PDF invoice via email.

38
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,850
Saves me having to log in when I receive it.

39
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,770
I can just view it straight away and I would like to receive free to usage alerts.

40
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:05,650
So that means when we're approaching or have exceeded our free to usage limits, we will get an email

41
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,790
to notify us.

42
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,060
I'm going to select this box and enter my email address.

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,600
Lastly, I'm going to select receive billing alerts as well and save these preferences.

44
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,390
Now the last thing I want to do is really important, and that is to create a budget so that I can get

45
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,010
an alert when my bill is starting to reach a certain limit.

46
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:33,970
So I've chosen budgets on the left hand side here and I can choose create a budget to create my budget.

47
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,390
And on this page you can leave the user template, simplified, selected, and then we have a couple

48
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,200
of options.

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,050
Now, you can either create a budget that notifies you once your spending exceeds the free tier limits

50
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,600
or choose a monthly cost budget.

51
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:56,200
Now I'm going to choose the monthly cost budget and I'm simply going to enter a small amount like you

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,480
could put in $5 or $10.

53
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,210
Now most of what we do should be in the free tier.

54
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:06,310
So it's unlikely that you're going to spend any money, but sometimes you might have a couple of dollars

55
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,150
here and there.

56
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,440
So all in all, a really, really cheap way to learn us.

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,730
Now we can see it's trying to calculate last month's cost, but we didn't have any because it's brand

58
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,000
new.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,170
So that's not going to work.

60
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,020
Now all you need to do here is enter your email address and then create the budget and that's it.

61
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:31,390
I have my monthly cost budget of $5 and I will get some notifications in my email inbox if I start getting

62
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,360
close to or exceed that budget.

63
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,560
So make sure you do that.

64
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,870
It's a great way to just safeguard against something accidental where you might leave something running

65
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,400
and rack up a bit of a bill.
