00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,628
Welcome to this lesson.

2
00:00:06,652 --> 00:00:11,051
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to assume an IAM role

3
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:12,650
from the management console.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,800
I'm logged into my account and I'm on the

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,130
dashboard of the identity and access management console.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,020
We're going to create a new user.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,760
So I'm going to go to users,

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,380
click add users

9
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:26,090
and I'm going to call my user Paul.

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,950
I'm only going to provide management console access for Paul at this point in time.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,690
I'm going to configure my own password

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,700
and I'm going to remove the requirement to reset the password.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,420
Then we can click next to go to permissions,

14
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:44,583
and I'm not going to provide any permissions to Paul at this point in time.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,460
Let's click on next,

16
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:48,203
review.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,510
It's going to warn me that of course Paul doesn't have any

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,500
permission so he's not going to be able to do anything.

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,160
Now Paul will be able to log into the console but then won't be able to do anything.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,030
Now let's just create this user.

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,850
So the user is being created.

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,430
And what we're going to do is go back to the main console.

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,568
So click on close.

24
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,460
Now, back on the user's pane here, I'm going to select Paul.

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,970
And what I want to do is I need Paul's ARN, so the amazon resource name.

26
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,250
So I'm going to click copy here to copy that to my clipboard.

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,411
Now you'll find a file in the course, download

28
00:01:22,435 --> 00:01:25,180
which you can download from the last lesson in section one.

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,060
And in there, once you've unzipped the course download, you'll find a code directory

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,540
IAM and then you will find this switch-role-trust-policy.JSON.

31
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,300
Now what I want to do in here is I need to enter the ARN

32
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,760
for Paul between these two inverted commas here.

33
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,390
So I'm just going to paste in Paul's ARN

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,660
and then I can copy all of this code

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,560
to my clipboard. Now this is the trust policy for the role.

36
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,070
Back in IAM, let's go to roles and we're going to create

37
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,930
the IAM role that Paul is going to assume.

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,550
So let's choose create role.

39
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,160
I'm going to choose custom trust policy

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,060
and then I'm going to delete the code in here

41
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,060
and paste in the code that we just updated.

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,760
So now we have a trust policy.

43
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,750
And this trust policy is going to allow

44
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,690
the principal and it's configured specifically for Paul

45
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,451
to assume a role.

46
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:26,170
So it's allowing Paul the privilege to be able to assume an IAM role.

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,050
Then we click on next.

48
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,660
And I'm going to search for EC2. So let's just search for EC2 in the top here.

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,860
And I'm going to select the Amazon EC2 full access.

50
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,460
So this IAM role is going to be assumable by Paul.

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,570
Paul will be allowed to assume this role.

52
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,640
And then when Paul assumes this role,

53
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,260
he will have the EC2 full access permissions.

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,160
So let's click on next.

55
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:53,910
Give it a name.

56
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,190
I'm going to call it EC2-full-access.

57
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,150
And then let's just scroll down and create that role.

58
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,200
So the role has been created.

59
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,098
All we need to do now is log in as Paul.

60
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:08,470
And we're going to see if we can assume this role.

61
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,220
I'm now logged in as Paul in a private window,

62
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,610
so I've still got my management console logged in

63
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,200
as myself and then in a private window, I'm logged in as Paul.

64
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,490
So if I now go over to the EC2 management console,

65
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,490
what we should see is these API errors.

66
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,180
And that's because Paul doesn't have any permissions.

67
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,370
So essentially it's saying you don't have

68
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,950
any permissions to view any of the information

69
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,195
in EC2.

70
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,540
And he wouldn't be able to launch instances or do anything in EC2.

71
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,070
So what we want to do is assume a role so that we can

72
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,950
then get those permissions through the IAM role that we created previously.

73
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,810
Now back in the console where I'm logged in as myself, I'm logged in as Neal,

74
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,400
I'm just going to go into this role. So let's click on the role.

75
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,690
And what you'll find is all the information you need to assume

76
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,590
the role is actually provided here.

77
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,140
There's even a link that you can use to do it for you.

78
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,460
Now, all we really need is the account number of the account and the name of the role.

79
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,960
So what I'm going to do is the easiest place to find the

80
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,940
account number is you just come back up to the dashboard,

81
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,760
click on copy and I've got that on my clipboard.

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,050
Now logged back in as Paul here, I'm going to go up into the top right hand corner,

83
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,860
choose switch role,

84
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,850
click switch role again,

85
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,660
I'm going to paste in my account number.

86
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,820
I need to put in the name of the role.

87
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,360
And then I can add a display name as well.

88
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,410
Once I've entered that information I can choose switch role.

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,000
And I've now switched roles and as you can see all those API errors have gone.

90
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,550
So we can now actually use EC2.

91
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,430
So what we've done is we've logged in as Paul.

92
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,100
Paul was unable to do anything in EC2 because he doesn't have any permissions

93
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,180
But the permission that we did assign was for Paul to be able to assume a role.

94
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,010
And once he assumed that role,

95
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,090
He had access to whatever the permissions assigned to that role are.

96
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,680
In this case, that's EC2 full access.

97
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,660
So now Paul is free to do whatever he wants in EC2

98
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,960
and could always then switch back

99
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,050
by just clicking on switch back

100
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,170
and then he will go back to being logged in purely as Paul.

101
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,750
And of course all the API errors return because Paul no longer has those permissions.

102
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,185
So that's how you assume a role using the AWS management console.

103
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,480
A bit later in the course,

104
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,160
we'll see how to do it using the command line interface as well.
