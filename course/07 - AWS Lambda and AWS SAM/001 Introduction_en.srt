Hi guys in this section, you're gonna learn all about AWS Lambda.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,550
Lambda is a service that is known as a serverless service.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,790
That means there's no actual underlying EC2 instances or other

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,250
servers that you have to manage that's all done for you

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,440
with lambda.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,760
What happens is you add code to lambda,

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,050
so units of code that you upload through various different mechanisms through the

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,610
console or from an S3 bucket or from the command line,

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,480
which we'll see

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,660
in this section

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,590
and once you've added your code in then there's

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,260
various different ways that your functions get triggered.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,790
Now you do really need to understand all of

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,810
these different mechanisms like synchronous and asynchronous invocation.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,090
So we're going to be practicing with those

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,210
after we've been through the theory lessons.

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,610
So there's lots of theory and lots of hands

18
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,960
on exercises where you're going to work with lambda

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:52,970
for the exam.

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,690
You also really need to understand things like lambda versions and aliases.

21
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,260
So we're not only going to do theory on those will also have lots

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,590
of hands on sessions where you'll get to practice using versions and aliases.

23
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,960
So you'll learn lots about lambda in this section.

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,270
Now at the end we actually cover the AWS Serverless application model as well.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,390
AWS SAM it's fairly brief because it's not covered in a lot of detail on the exam but

26
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,950
I just want to let you know what it is and we'll see how it actually works.

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,860
So I hope you enjoy the section, I'll see you in the next lesson
