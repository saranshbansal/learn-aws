00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,320
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network, a CDN. The purpose of a CDN is to improve the performance

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,360
of accessing objects.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,940
And what I mean by objects here, it's basically files. So, it could be image files, it could be video

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,280
files, it could be pretty much any file type.

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,190
Now, we're specifically looking here at helping performance over a large geographical area, perhaps

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,120
the entire world.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,630
So, you might have some content that's somewhere like North America, but you have users all the way over

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,100
in China, in Japan, and Australia, and that's a big physical distance.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,010
And that long physical distance means that there's more latency and poor performance.

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,190
So, what we're trying to do is get the content closer to those users. And we have two particular things

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,770
that you really need to understand that are components of CloudFront, and that's an origin and a distribution.

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,880
So let's have a look.

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,190
So, CloudFront origins are literally the origin of where the content is coming from.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,030
So, for instance, you can have Amazon S3, so your content can be sitting as objects in Amazon

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,000
S3 and you want to get that closer to users.

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,510
Or it could be Amazon EC2.

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,850
So maybe your content is on an Amazon EC2 instance.

18
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,790
Maybe it's a website, maybe it's a mounted file system on EFS, but the content is being served

19
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,980
by EC2. And those EC2 instances can also be behind a load balancer.

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,360
So, that's the origin, and the origin is within a single region.

21
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,970
So, it's in one physical place in the world.

22
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,850
Now, we then have something called edge locations.

23
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:49,170
Edge locations are actually all over the world. And there's hundreds of edge locations located in different

24
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,020
parts of the world.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,690
And what happens is the content from the origin gets pushed out and cached in the edge location.

26
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,590
And so, the idea being that those edge locations are distributed broadly around the world, and that

27
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,360
means your content is somewhere where it can be closer to the users who want to access it.

28
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,410
So, we have users accessing the edge locations.

29
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,410
So as you can see, these users are in all sorts of different places around the world.

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,760
So, as you may know, latency is essentially the delay.

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,490
So it means that the greater the latency, the poorer the performance. If you have high latency when you're

32
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,480
trying to access a video, you're going to get a really bad experience.

33
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,650
Latency is primarily a factor of distance.

34
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,970
The farther you are from, wherever you're trying to play that video, then the greater the latency.

35
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,280
But there are also other factors as well such as the number of hops, the number of routers and switches,

36
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,160
the amount of congestion and oversubscription on the line somewhere between you and the content you're

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,150
trying to access.

38
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,650
So, CloudFront aims to resolve a lot of this. And it does say a couple of ways.

39
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:06,210
Firstly, the content gets cached in an edge location, which means hopefully it's physically much,

40
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,490
much closer to where your users are, so they can then access the content in the edge location.

41
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,710
And what happens is users are directed automatically to the closest edge location.

42
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,900
So, if your users are in Asia, they might have a different edge location than if they're in Australia

43
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,460
or India or so on.

44
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,670
So, they get access to that content faster.

45
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,310
Now, if the content doesn't happen to be on the edge location at that point in time, maybe it expired

46
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,000
from the cache, then it has to be pulled from the origin.

47
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,800
But even here, it's going over the AWS global network, not the internet.

48
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,650
And that means lower latency and better performance.

49
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,820
Let's look at origins and distributions in a bit more detail.

50
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,780
So, a distribution is what you create in CloudFront.

51
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:58,680
When you create a distribution, you get a name or an access endpoint for that distribution. And the

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,140
standard endpoint looks something like this.

53
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,330
You'll have some combination of characters and numbers .cloudfront.net.

54
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,260
You can then use your own custom domain.

55
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:14,490
That's something you can do, so you can have your own domain name like dctcloudlabs.com,

56
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,440
or whatever you have available.

57
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,670
Now, when you create your CloudFront distribution, you also specify the origin. And your origin

58
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,990
is where your files are.

59
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,020
You can even have multiple origins as well.

60
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,290
You might have an S3 origin and a custom origin.

61
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,490
The custom origin is EC2 or EC2 behind a load balancer.

62
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,490
With CloudFront, we're creating something called a web distribution. And this speeds up the distribution

63
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,530
of static and dynamic content.

64
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:51,510
So, any of those file types on the screen there. You access your web distribution using HTTP or HTTPS,

65
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,850
and you can add, update, or delete objects and even submit data through a web form.

66
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,990
You can even use live streaming for real time events as well.

67
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,790
Now, there used to be something called an RTMP

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,750
distribution.

69
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,550
These were discontinued.

70
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,900
So they're not actually available anymore. And you shouldn't see these coming up in the exam.

71
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,120
We also have something called a behavior that we can configure within our distribution.

72
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,890
And this means we can look for things like a path pattern. With a path pattern

73
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:27,200
you might say that if somebody is looking for a specific path/something, then they should go

74
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,280
to the S3 origin.

75
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,570
If they're going to a different path, then maybe they have to go to the customer origin.

76
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:40,250
You can configure the protocol policy you want to use, whether you redirect to HTTPS to stop people making

77
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,650
unsecured connections and that kind of thing.

78
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,710
You can define the cache policy, which helps you to work out how long things stay in the cache and

79
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,270
the origin requests policy.

80
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:58,550
So, how do you configure the security and other factors of the connection from your edge locations to your

81
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,890
origin when they need to request content.

82
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,140
And by the way, you can also use a static website as an origin running on S3.

83
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,340
So that's it for the theory.

84
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,400
What we're going to do in the next lesson is create a web distribution in CloudFront.

85
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,130
And we're going to have a look at how we can configure caching behaviors so that we can send certain

86
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,500
requests to two different S3 origins.

87
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,840
So I hope that was useful.

88
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,050
I'll see you in the next lesson.
