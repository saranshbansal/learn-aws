1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,040
In this lesson, we're going to create a static website on Amazon S3

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,925
and then we're going to create a CloudFront distribution in front of

3
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,200
our static website.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,956
And we'll use an origin access identity to secure access

5
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:24,170
so that people can only access the static website through CloudFront.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,810
They can't go directly to the S3 bucket.

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,390
I'm back in, Amazon S3 and I'm going to create a new bucket.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,310
I'm going to give this one a name.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,350
I'm going to call mine My Static Website-DCT. Hopefully that name is unique.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,270
It's going to be in the us-east-1 region.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,190
I do recommend you use us-east-1 whenever you're using a CloudFront distribution.

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,040
It can make it a lot faster to actually converge and become ready.

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,850
So use us-east-1 for your bucket.

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,840
We're not going to enable ACLs

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,440
and we're not going to enable public access.

16
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,760
We're just going to scroll down to the bottom and create the bucket.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,620
So I've got that bucket.

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,420
Now at the moment, we don't have any public access to

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,623
this bucket and I'm actually going to keep it that way.

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,120
But I do need to upload some files.

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,760
So I'm going to add files.

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,860
And in the code Amazon S3 directory you should find error.html and index.html.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,750
So we're going to upload these two files

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,580
and click on upload.

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,360
So those have been added. Next, we need to go to properties,

26
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,660
scroll all the way to the bottom and this is where we enable static website hosting.

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,650
So we click on enable.

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,960
We're going to host a static website.

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,270
And we're going to use index.html and error.html for the two documents.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,460
So I've added my document names and then I simply save my changes.

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,050
when you do that, you will find that there's a URL for the bucket.

32
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,660
So at the bottom of the page here I can see a URL.

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,690
I'm going to copy that to my clipboard.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,760
And I just want to check if this is accessible. It shouldn't be accessible.

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,340
And sure enough it says access denied.

36
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,895
And that's fine. I'm actually going to leave it this way.

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,380
I don't want anyone to be able to come and directly access this S3 bucket.

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,830
I want them to only be able to access

39
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,050
the contents of the bucket via the CloudFront distribution.

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,680
I've opened the CloudFront management console

41
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,560
and here I'm just going to create a CloudFront distribution.

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,960
For origin domain name here, we'll see the actual S3 bucket.

43
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,500
So as you can see you can choose S3 buckets, Elastic Load Balancers,

44
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,750
media store containers, and media package containers.

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,150
So I'm going to choose my static website.

46
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,020
I'm not going to enter an origin path.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,510
The name is fine. I don't need to change that.

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,420
Now we are going to use an origin access identity, so I need to click yes.

49
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,640
Now, we can select from existing OAIs

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,260
or we can create a new one.

51
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,790
So we'll create a new OAI. I'm happy with the name that it suggests.

52
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,180
And that's now specified.

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,960
So that is the identity that's being created through CloudFront.

54
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,010
And what we want to do is update the bucket policy.

55
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,190
And that will actually add a bucket policy that only allows access to the bucket

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,390
if the caller is this particular OAI.

57
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,260
Let's just scroll down now. We're going to leave the default cache behavior.

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,420
We want to use HTTP and HTTPS.

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,220
And then we just scroll down farther.

60
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,250
We can leave all of these settings as they are.

61
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,260
The only thing we need to update

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,260
is the default root object which needs to be index.html.

63
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,850
So make sure you put in index.html as the default root object

64
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,760
and then create distribution.

65
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,110
Now it can take several minutes for the CloudFront distribution

66
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,720
to deploy and become ready. So at the moment we can see it's in the deploying status.

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,100
And that should change within the next 5-10 minutes.

68
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,160
While that's happening. Let's go back to our static website.

69
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,660
And I want to go across to the permissions page.

70
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,918
And here we can actually see the bucket policy that was automatically added

71
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,010
by CloudFront.

72
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,450
So this policy has a statement which is allow

73
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,190
and then it specifies a principal.

74
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,860
And that principal is the origin access identity.

75
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:21,860
And only that principal will be allowed the get object permission.

76
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,105
And you can see the resource is also locked down to this particular bucket

77
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:28,410
and its contents.

78
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,920
So that all looks good.

79
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,060
Let's go back to CloudFront and let's just wait a few minutes for it to become ready.

80
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,870
It's been a few minutes and I refresh my page and it does look like it's now deployed.

81
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,300
So let's copy the distribution domain name to our clipboards

82
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,970
and then go over to a new browser window.

83
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,250
I'm going to paste it in.

84
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,300
And we can see the web page, that's the index.html from our bucket, which tells

85
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,730
us we've successfully launched a static website

86
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:59,160
and then we've securely accessed it through amazon CloudFront.

87
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,030
So it's as simple as that just to serve a static website through CloudFront.

88
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,283
And of course we've used an OAI here to make sure that there's no way that anyone

89
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,596
can directly access the S3 bucket.

90
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:13,360
They must come through the CloudFront distribution.

91
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,470
Now I've finished with the distribution for this demonstration, but feel

92
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,170
free to go and have a look around the various options

93
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,560
that you can configure through CloudFront.

94
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,060
What I want to do now that I've finished is select my distribution

95
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,770
and then click on disable.

96
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,550
And then disable again.

97
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,850
Now it will take several minutes for this to happen. Until it's fully disabled,

98
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
you will not be able to delete it.

99
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,180
So just make sure you don't forget about it.

100
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,460
Give it a few minutes, probably 10-15 minutes maximum

101
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,260
and then you can delete your distribution
