00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,630
Server Access Logging is simply a way that we can log around the events that happen in our Amazon S3

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,230
buckets.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,680
So, what we do is we can go to our bucket and enable logging.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,130
And we choose a target bucket.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,930
Now, you do want the target bucket to be a different bucket to the source bucket.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,840
Otherwise, you can get a circular loop where every time there's an update you're writing to the same

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,710
bucket, which causes another update, and the loop kind of just goes on and on.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,160
Now, you can also choose a target prefix as well.

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,310
So, this provides detailed records of the requests that are made to an S3 bucket.

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:49,490
And the information that you can log includes the requester, the bucket name, the request time,

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,670
action, response status, and error code

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:00,050
if it's applicable. It is disabled by default, so you have to go in and manually enable server access

13
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,210
logging and choose your target bucket.

14
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,050
You only ever pay for the storage used, and you must configure a separate bucket as the destination,

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,130
so always do that.

16
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:17,420
You also need to grant write permissions to the Amazon S3 Log Delivery group on the destination bucket.

17
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,870
So, you remember when we were looking at ACLs on a bucket, there was an option to configure permissions

18
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,210
for the Amazon S3 Log Delivery group.

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,230
That's where you would tick the box, which allows write access.

20
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,690
Now, it's very easy to implement if you want to go and have a practice. It does take a bit of time sometimes

21
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,850
to actually see the logs come through, but just create yourself a target bucket and then go to your

22
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,630
source bucket,

23
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,770
enable logging,

24
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,710
specify the target and optionally a prefix.
