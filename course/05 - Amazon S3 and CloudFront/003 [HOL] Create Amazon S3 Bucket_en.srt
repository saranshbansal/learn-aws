00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,950
Hi guys, this is the first of several hands-on lessons for Amazon S3.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,870
And in this lesson we're simply going to go and have a look at how we can create

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,170
an Amazon S3 bucket using the management console.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,300
I'm in the management console for Amazon S3 and here you'll

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,100
be able to see your buckets if you already have some.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,210
Now we don't actually have any in this particular account.

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,040
So what I'm going to do is click on create buckets.

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,580
Now, the first thing we need to do is give it a bucket name.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,750
Now you'll notice that with S3, this is a global service so you can't choose a region

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:46,260
and that's because the namespace for Amazon S3 uses DNS and is therefore global.

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,670
So just like you can only have one Amazon.com,

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,830
you can only have one bucket name globally.

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,210
It uses DNS.

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,420
So we have to create a bucket name that's completely unique around the world.

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,360
There's no other S3 buckets with that specific name.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,911
So for example, I'm going to call mine DCT Cloud S3 HOL,

17
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:08,350
and hopefully that is unique around the world.

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,380
Now if you want to use a similar name,

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,250
you can always just add on some random characters at the end.

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,300
Now, even though it is a global namespace,

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,460
you do actually select where your data is going to be stored.

22
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,450
So you can select the region and your data will be stored within that region only.

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,529
Now your data is never replicated outside of that region

24
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:31,350
unless you specifically enable that to happen.

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,860
So here, I'm going to choose us-east-1.

26
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,538
If you want to you can choose another bucket and it will actually copy the settings

27
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:40,780
from that bucket across.

28
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:42,760
In this case we're not going to do that.

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,460
Next there's objects ownership.

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,618
This is specifying whether ACLs, Access Control Lists

31
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,130
are enabled or not for this bucket.

32
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,140
It's a relatively new setting.

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,660
So this didn't used to be here, but it's been here for several months now.

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,640
What I want to do is actually enable ACLs. They are useful for some specific use cases

35
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,390
and we will be doing a hands-on where we use ACLs a bit later on.

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,350
So I'm going to leave those enabled with bucket owner preferred, the default option.

37
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,790
And then let's go down a little bit further.

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,220
Now, AWS is trying to enforce default security.

39
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,760
So one of the things they do is they block all public access by default.

40
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,860
So if for example you wanted the contents of your bucket to be available

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,540
for anyone in the world who is not authenticated,

42
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,500
then you would need to disable this setting.

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,060
And that way you would enable the ability

44
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,860
to have your contents of your buckets publicly accessible.

45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,660
And then you can actually use the ACLs or other settings to

46
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,318
make sure that they are available.

47
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:48,160
And that's something we'll look at later on.

48
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,550
For now, I'm going to leave the default setting.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,430
Bucket versioning is a feature where it will keep

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,250
multiple variants of the files that you upload to S3.

51
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,580
So for example, if you uploaded a word document

52
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,560
and then you made some modifications to that document,

53
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,360
saved it with the same file name and then uploaded that to S3,

54
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,540
you would now actually have two versions.

55
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,948
So you could go back to the older version if you needed to.

56
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:16,540
You can enable tags and you can also specify encryption for your bucket.

57
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,356
We're going to look at that as well later on.

58
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,760
Now I'm happy with these settings. So I'm just going to create my bucket.

59
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,880
So my bucket has been successfully created.

60
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,560
You can see the name, you can see the region,

61
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,060
and some other information.

62
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:32,378
So what I'm going to do now is just select my bucket and let's go in

63
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:34,060
and have a look at some of the settings.

64
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,610
The first screen we come to is objects.

65
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,950
This is where you can actually upload and view the objects in your bucket.

66
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,280
So objects can be any type of file can be video files can be photos,

67
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,260
can be word documents and much, much more.

68
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,550
So we can easily upload our objects here.

69
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,160
If I click on upload

70
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,500
and then choose a file,

71
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,230
so let's choose this beach.jpg.

72
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,650
Click on upload.

73
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,160
So the file is now ready for upload.

74
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,410
Now we can specify the ACL permissions on this if we want to.

75
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,150
We'll look at that in another lesson.

76
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,860
And also if we click on properties here,

77
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,020
this is where you can specify the storage class

78
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,750
that your object is going to belong to.

79
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,050
The default is standard and that's available through three availability zones.

80
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,580
And of course if you want to lower the cost you can use things like One Zone-IA

81
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,860
Or Standard I A.

82
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,860
I'll just leave this on standard.

83
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,850
You can then specify the encryption settings for this particular object.

84
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,050
We can also enable checksums, tags, and metadata.

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,200
Now I'm just going to click on upload.

86
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,560
And that has succeeded.

87
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,460
And so now we have our jpeg file in the objects pane here.

88
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,500
Next we've got properties.

89
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,896
Here you can see things like the ARN for your bucket

90
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:58,850
if you need to copy that to your clipboard so you can use it somewhere.

91
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,470
You can change the versioning status,

92
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,760
add tags for the bucket rather than the objects which we just saw a moment ago.

93
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,300
You can specify the default encryption,

94
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,580
intelligent-tiering archive configs, server access logging, CloudTrail data events,

95
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,740
event notifications, and Amazon EventBridge.

96
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,540
So you can actually send information about what's

97
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,780
happening in your bucket to these services.

98
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,860
We'll look at event notifications a bit later on in this section.

99
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,370
You can also enable transfer acceleration and that improves

100
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,960
the upload speeds for your objects, but it does come at a cost.

101
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,780
We've got object lock, requester pays

102
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,660
and also static website hosting. Again, we'll look at that later on in this section.

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,320
Back at the top here, we then have the permissions pane. And in here

104
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,250
you can change that block public access settings, add your bucket policies.

105
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,490
We'll definitely look at those shortly as well.

106
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,710
You can modify the object ownership settings, ACLs,

107
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,550
and enable cross origin resource sharing.

108
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,360
There's also metrics about the data in your bucket.

109
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,820
There's a few things that we can do on the management page

110
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,490
including specifying our lifecycle rules if we want to specify rules for when

111
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,460
our data is moved between different storage classes.

112
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,460
There are replication rules for replicating our data

113
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,580
between buckets in the same or different regions,

114
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,760
and inventory configurations as well.

115
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,150
And lastly, there are access points.

116
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,560
So you can actually create your own named network endpoints for accessing S3.

117
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,420
So that's a quick overview of creating buckets and looking

118
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,830
at these settings that we can apply to our buckets.

119
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,560
And in subsequent lessons we're going to do some more hands-on working with S3.
