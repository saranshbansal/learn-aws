# Amazon Cognito
Amazon Cognito is a service provided by AWS that simplifies user authentication, authorization, and user management for web and mobile applications.

- Your users can sign in directly with a user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, or Google.
- Users can sign-up and sign-in using email, phone number, or user name.
- End users of an application can also sign in with SMS-based MFA.
- There is an import tool for migrating users into an Amazon Cognito User Pool.

With Amazon Cognito, you can focus on building great app experiences instead of managing complex authentication and authorization code. It scales to millions of users and is available in multiple AWS regions worldwide.

## User Pools and Identity Pools

![alt text](images/image-cognito.png)

The two main components of AWS Cognito are **user pools** and **identity pools**:

- User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users.
- Identity pools enable you to grant your users access to other AWS services.

You can use identity pools and user pools separately or together.

No need for the application to embed or store AWS credentials locally on the device and it gives users a seamless experience across all mobile devices.

Cognito Identity provides temporary security credentials to access your appâ€™s backend resources in AWS or any service behind Amazon API Gateway.

## User Pools

![alt text](images/image-cognito_user_pools.png)

Cognito User Pools are user directories used to manage sign-up and sign-in functionality for mobile and web applications for your app users.

Users can also sign in through social identity providers like Facebook or Amazon, and through SAML identity providers.

Whether users sign-in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through an SDK.

Cognito acts as an **Identity Broker** between the **ID provider** and **AWS**.

User pools provide:

- Sign-up and sign-in services.
- A built-in, customizable web UI to sign in users.
- Social sign-in with *Facebook*, *Google*, and *Login with Amazon*, as well as sign-in with SAML identity providers from your user pool.
- User directory management and user profiles.
- Security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), checks for compromised credentials, account takeover protection, and phone and email verification.
- Customized workflows and user migration through AWS Lambda triggers.
- After successfully authenticating a user, Amazon Cognito issues **JSON web tokens (JWT)** that you can use to secure and authorize access to your own APIs, or exchange for AWS credentials.

## Identity Pools

Identity Pools enable you to create unique identities for your users and authenticate them with identity providers.

With an identity, you can obtain temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials to access other AWS services.

Cognito tracks the association between user identity and the various different devices they sign-in from.

In order to provide a seamless user experience for your application, Cognito uses Push Synchronization to push updates and synchronize user data across multiple devices.

Amazon SNS is used to send a silent push notification to all the devices whenever data stored in the cloud changes.

Amazon Cognito identity pools support the following identity providers:

- Public providers: Login with Amazon (Identity Pools), Facebook (Identity Pools), Google (Identity Pools).
- Amazon Cognito User Pools.
- Open ID Connect Providers (Identity Pools).
- SAML Identity Providers (Identity Pools).
- Developer Authenticated Identities (Identity Pools).

### Developer Authenticated Identities
With developer authenticated identities, you can register and authenticate users via your own existing authentication process, while still using Amazon Cognito to synchronize user data and access AWS resources.
Using developer authenticated identities involves interaction between the end user device, your backend for authentication, and Amazon Cognito.

>> **Exam tip:** To make it easier to remember the different between User Pools and Identity Pools, think of Users Pools as being like IAM Users or Active Directory and an Identity Pools as being like an IAM Role.

## Amazon Cognito Sync
Amazon Cognito Sync is an AWS service and client library that enables cross-device syncing of application-related user data.

You can use it to synchronize user profile data across mobile devices and the web without requiring your own backend.

The client libraries cache data locally so your app can read and write data regardless of device connectivity status.

When the device is online, you can synchronize data, and if you set up push sync, notify other devices immediately that an update is available.

>> **Exam tip:** AWS AppSync is a similar service that has additional capabilities. With AppSync you can synchronize mobile app data across devices and users (Cognito Sync cannot synchronize across users, only devices), it has support for additional devices and data types, and is based on GraphQL.

# AWS IAM
#### Components - `IAM users` | `IAM groups` | `IAM roles` | `IAM policy`

- As best practice, it is advisable not to use the root user account for your day-to-day operations. AWS recommends you create separate individual `IAM users` with enough permissions required to carry out all tasks required to fulfil their job function. AWS IAM allows you to create and configure identities for your AWS account. You can apply permissions to those identities, determining the level of access granted.
- When granting access to services, you must follow the principle of least privilege (POLP) as recommended by AWS. This ensures that those identities are provided with only the necessary access needed to carry out approved tasks and perform their job functions. 
- **IAM roles** - An identity independent of any specific user or application with one or more policies that define a set of permissions to access services and resources on AWS. Roles can be assigned to users, aws services, 3rd party entities etc. With IAM roles, it is the STS services that handles creating and managing these temporary credentials in the background.
- **IAM policy** - A JSON document adheres to the IAM policy standard, which outlines the permissions defined by a specific IAM role.

#### AWS IAM - Access delegation workflow
The following diagram depicts how you can establish delegated access across two AWS accounts:
![alt text](images/image-iam_delegate_access.png)

As shown in the Figure, we use the example of a developer in the `Identities` Account that needs to access an `S3 bucket` (called `TodoApp`) in the `Development` Account. This is known as `cross-account access`, and the following are the primary steps involved in configuring this:

1. In the Development Account, you must configure a role with a trust policy that identifies the trusted account (in this case, the Identities Account). In this example, we named the IAM Role `IAM-User-S3-AccessRole` as per the diagram. The configuration requires you to provide the ID for Account A.

2. You will also need to configure a policy that contains the necessary permissions to perform read/write operations against the TodoApp S3 bucket in Account B.

3. Finally, in Account A, you need to configure another policy that grants the developer the ability to assume the S3AccessRole created in Account B. You do this by specifying the Account ID of Account B and the role in the policy statement. The policy will grant the sts:AssumeRole permission as per the following JSON script:

```json
{
  "Version": "2024-06-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::Developer-Account-ID:role/S3AccessRole"
  }
}
```

4. Once the above configuration is in place, the developers can switch roles and access the TodoApp S3 bucket in AWS Account B.

**Note: With the new IAM Identity Center Service (previously known as AWS Single Sign On), you may not need to use cross-account access extensively for IAM users. This is because the IAM Identity Center offers an alternative approach to granting your workforce users access to multiple out-of-the-box accounts in your AWS Organizations. These users can be from AWS Identity Providers as well as external providers.**
