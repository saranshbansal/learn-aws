00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,100
Hi guys and welcome to the Bcs Labs Part one.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,280
So this is the first of a five part exercise where we're going to do free parts.

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,130
So the first free lessons will be in this section

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,960
and the final two are going to be in the next section. These are all hands on lessons.

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,060
So we're gonna get quite in depth with pcs,

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,520
we're gonna use the elastic container registry.

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,600
We're gonna create a Fargate cluster,

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,660
use task definitions with a service and an application load balancer.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,880
And in the next section we're going to see how

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,350
we can also create a pipeline using codedeploy and Codepipeline.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,940
And we're going to implement a blue green update

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,110
where when we make changes to our image,

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,900
we can push it through to our running deployment.

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,050
So should be a lot of fun. Lots of hands on practice here.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,000
So we're on part One.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,780
And what we're gonna do in this lesson is we're gonna launch an ec two instance.

17
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,740
We're going to install Docker on that instance

18
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,880
and then we're going to create a private repository

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,870
and we're gonna push an engine X image up to our private repository.

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,760
So it should be an interesting exercise. Let's get started.

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,160
Now you'll find this file which has got lots of information in it,

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,670
including lots of the command lines that we're going to run

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,460
and that's going to be in your code downloads of course download,

24
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,360
go to code e c s and then you'll find pcs labs instructions dot MD.

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,780
So the first thing you can see here is we're gonna launch an ec two instance.

26
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,990
It's going to be a Linux two a.m. I T two micro,

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,570
we're gonna connect using instance, connect

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,740
and then we're gonna run a series of commands.

29
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,360
So let's head over to the console.

30
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,410
So in the console here, I'm going to go to ec two.

31
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,160
Let's launch an instance. We're gonna choose the amazon Linux two.

32
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,060
Am I just leave the defaults T two micro

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,050
choose our key pair

34
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,990
for security group. I'm happy just to allow ssh traffic.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,700
If you've got an existing security group, you can use that as long as it provides

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,160
that access. I'm happy creating a new one

37
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,930
and for storage, I'll leave the defaults,

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,800
we don't need to specify anything for advanced details at at this point in time.

39
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,050
So let's just launch our instance.

40
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,180
So we'll give our instance a moment to launch and then we'll connect using instance,

41
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,660
connect.

42
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,550
My instance is now running

43
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,460
so I'm going to click on connect,

44
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,260
connect again

45
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,560
and that should put me into

46
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,650
the command line on my instance.

47
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,950
So here we are.

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,110
Now, what I'm going to do is run Sudo S. U.

49
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,760
That's just going to give us some more privileges that we can use.

50
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,490
And then I'm gonna run yum update

51
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,880
and there are no packages marked for update at this time. So that's great.

52
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,780
So what I'm gonna do is run yum, install Docker.

53
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,150
So this is going to install Docker,

54
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,880
I just type why I do want to do this

55
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,960
and that completed fairly quickly.

56
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,250
Now, I'm now going to just paste in the next couple of commands,

57
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,710
you can find these back in that file I just showed you.

58
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,070
So this is going to enable the doctor's service.

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,280
The next one is to actually start the Docker service.

60
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,260
So I'm going to copy that to my clipboard from my file

61
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,870
and then just start the Docker service

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,360
so that should be running.

63
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,550
So now Docker is running,

64
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,330
let me just clear my screen and just bring this down

65
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,350
to the middle so you can see a bit more easily.

66
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,160
And I'm going to run Docker

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,850
pull

68
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,240
Engine X

69
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,460
so we can see that's downloading

70
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,690
the latest

71
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,750
image for engine X, which is latest here.

72
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,160
So we've got that now. So if I run Docker images,

73
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,100
we should see

74
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,860
that. We've got Engine X

75
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,370
and it's the latest it's tagged as the latest.

76
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,560
So that's great. What else do we need to do? Let's head back to our file.

77
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,670
So this is where we're at. We've just run all those commands.

78
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,470
We now need to create an I am role

79
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,740
and use the policy in this particular file.

80
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,460
So I've opened that file which of course is in the course download and amazon ec. S

81
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,560
and what I'm gonna do is copy

82
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,950
all of this code here.

83
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,770
So this is this is going to provide access to the E

84
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,130
C R service so that we can actually upload our image.

85
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,650
So now in I am I'm going to go to policies create policy,

86
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,860
go to Jason delete this code, paste my code in

87
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,100
and I'm just gonna use this as the name for the policy.

88
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,750
So I'm gonna copy ec our policy to my clipboard,

89
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,810
click on next. Go to review, give it a name, paste that in

90
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,650
and create our policy. So we've now got our E C. R. Policy

91
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,400
That will be what we need to add to the role that we create.

92
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
So we're going to create a role of course this is going to be

93
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,960
assumed by 82 so we choose easy to as the common use case.

94
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,550
I then need to find my policy. I can see mine just here.

95
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,560
So I'm gonna select my policy,

96
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,490
click on next

97
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,750
for the role name.

98
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,320
I'm just going to change this to pcr dash role

99
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,470
and that now has the permissions and the trust policy that I need.

100
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,080
So I'm gonna create my role.

101
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,360
The role has been created so we're gonna go back to the Ec two management console now.

102
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,170
And what I want to do is select my instance, go to actions,

103
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,280
go to security modify I am wrong

104
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,160
and then I'm going to select my E C R dash roll

105
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,850
and choose update.

106
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,710
So we now have the permissions we need

107
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,670
to access e C R to upload our image.

108
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,660
So back in our instructions now you can see we now have a series of commands to run.

109
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,170
So we're going to create a repository and give it a

110
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,450
name and it's just going to be called Engine X.

111
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,540
And it's going to be in us East one.

112
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,600
We're then going to tag our container

113
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,750
with latest

114
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,680
and we're going to upload it now.

115
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,970
You need to change this account number here to your account number.

116
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,960
Now mine is set up correctly so I can just copy this entire command.

117
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,360
And we're going to go and create the repository. So back in the command line here

118
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,300
I'm going to run this command

119
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,760
we can see that that has actually created a repository. So if you open up the E C.

120
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,820
R console to go to elastic container registry

121
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,360
then you should find that you now have your repository.

122
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,630
So that looks good.

123
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,990
The next command

124
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,820
is this one so make sure that you have updated

125
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,330
your account number. So this should be your account number.

126
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,710
The rest should be the same.

127
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,650
You should be in the same region as me.

128
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,750
So I'm going to copy that to my clipboard,

129
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,420
paste that one in. I've run that command.

130
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,750
Let me just clear screen and bring stuff down to the middle again for you.

131
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,540
And then the next command again. Make sure your account number is set up correctly.

132
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,390
So now we're gonna run the get log in password

133
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,390
Using the US East one.

134
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,230
We're piping the results of that to Dhaka log in.

135
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,150
So we're going to get the login password

136
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,830
pipe that to docker login user name,

137
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,550
aws password and it's going to be whatever we got from this first part of the command.

138
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,520
And then we've got the account number which you need to update.

139
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,660
And of course the the path to our repository.

140
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,460
So let's run that command.

141
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,160
So I ran that command

142
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,520
and you can see there's a warning but it said log in succeeded.

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,880
So that's all we want to see.

144
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,510
And the last command here

145
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,850
is to push

146
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,470
our container image up to the repositories.

147
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,800
So again make sure you've updated your your account number here,

148
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,160
copy that to your clipboard.

149
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,760
Let's come back and let's push

150
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,950
our image

151
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,580
So that's pushing the image up to the elastic container registry service.

152
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,240
That was pretty fast.

153
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,140
Let's go to Ec are now and if we go into our repository

154
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,460
we can see that we have our image with a tag of latest

155
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,800
and that's it for this lesson. We're finished for this one.

156
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,610
Just leave everything as it is.

157
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,000
