1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,270
Welcome back in this lesson. We're going to continue from the last lesson.

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,250
In the last lesson we created our pcs cluster,

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,640
we added a container host to it running on Ec two.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,860
So we're using the EC two launch type.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,120
And in this lesson we're going to create a task definition.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,140
Launch a task on our cluster

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,920
and then we'll see how we can also create a service

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,160
with an elastic load balancer and a lb application load balancer.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,250
So let's head over to the console.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,210
So back in the console I have my Ec S cluster under infrastructure,

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,010
I have my running E C.

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,560
S container host so we can see that that's active and working.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,790
So what I want to do now is go to task definitions,

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,920
we're going to create a new task definition for this lab and it

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,900
will also be Engine X but I want to show you the setting.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,660
So I'm gonna call it my dash Engine X

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,240
then

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,310
for the container and we're also going to call this one just engine X.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,080
And then for the image, this is where we actually specify

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,160
the engine X image with the latest revision

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,460
and it's gonna pull that image down

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,740
and that's gonna be the application running So Engine X is a simple web service

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,550
and that's what we're going to run

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,830
now. I'm going to leave the container ports here as paul.

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,510
This is a web service.

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,260
I don't need to make any other changes here

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,960
so let's click on next.

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,410
What I want to do now is change the Ec two instances.

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,650
I don't want to use this one with Fargate. So I'm just going to enable EC two.

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,710
I'm gonna leave

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,220
the setting here for

32
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,350
X- 86-64

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,280
for V C p U. I am going to change this, I'm gonna change this right down to 0.25.

34
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,160
Now, make sure you leave V CPU there

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,780
And under memory just .5

36
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,860
and then G B now you do this is where there's a bit of a it's a bit of a strange console.

37
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,900
You can't just specify, for instance, 0.5 or 0.5, it has to be 0.5.

38
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,560
Space G B same with the CPU.

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,350
So those do have to be specified exactly as I show them here,

40
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,500
we're not going to specify a task role And for network mode,

41
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,850
I'm gonna change this to AWS VPC

42
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,490
so then we can scroll down,

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,850
click on next,

44
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,600
scroll down again

45
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,750
and create.

46
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,090
So we do need to be very specific with these

47
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,260
settings to make this task definition work with the easy to

48
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,680
launch type in the old console actually gave you an

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,700
option to configure the launch type that you are using.

50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,780
They don't seem to have that anymore. And that's why it can be a little bit tricky

51
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,060
if you don't know the specific settings that will work.

52
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,610
Now we can go back to our cluster,

53
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,530
click on tasks,

54
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,260
run new task

55
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,470
Now you need to change the compute configuration because it's

56
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,940
gonna default to fargate using a capacity provider strategy.

57
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,850
We want to use launch type and then we can swap to ec two

58
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,130
we're gonna launch a task at this point in time,

59
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,470
choose family

60
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,960
and I'm gonna choose my engine x. The one I just created

61
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,860
and it's there's only one revision so that's easy

62
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,760
For networking.

63
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,620
What we should see is it's also going to go into

64
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,340
the same default VPC with all of those subnets enabled.

65
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,590
So I don't need to change anything there. So that's okay.

66
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,140
The security group we will need to have a

67
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,960
security group which allows access to ports 80.

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,600
So if you've got one use that right now.

69
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,010
Otherwise you can always go and change this

70
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,470
default security group and add in the rule.

71
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,250
So I'm gonna just deploy

72
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,110
and the task has been successfully launched.

73
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,710
We can see the task is here and it's provisioning

74
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,760
so it shouldn't take long to actually start this container.

75
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,030
The task is now running

76
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,260
If I click on the task I. D. Here we can see some more information.

77
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,040
Now,

78
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,990
one thing to note is we don't have a public

79
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,450
ip address so how can we connect to this task?

80
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,500
Well, when you're on the Ec two launch type using the AWS VPc,

81
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,110
it's not as the network mode that is it's not going to give you

82
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,670
a public I P you actually have to put a load balancer in front

83
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,260
and for that we need a service.

84
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,959
So what I'm gonna do

85
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,260
his head back up to tasks,

86
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,660
choose my task. We're just going to stop this task. We don't need this one anymore.

87
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,150
So we have to confirm by typing stop

88
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,260
that should just take a moment.

89
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,750
We can see

90
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,560
what's going on at the top pair.

91
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,960
Our task has successfully stopped.

92
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,650
So now I'm gonna go to services,

93
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,050
click on deploy,

94
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,090
change the compute configuration again

95
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,060
Back to Ec two.

96
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,210
We've got service specified,

97
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,160
we're going to choose the same task definition and revision.

98
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,380
I'm gonna give it a service name. Just going to call this my E C S dash service.

99
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,460
You can now specify the number of tasks you want to be running at any time

100
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,310
Now we've only got one contained hosts.

101
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm happy just leaving it as one Of course if you have more container hosts you

102
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,490
can or you have more capacity in your container host then you can run more.

103
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,380
We could probably run a couple but one's

104
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,250
fine just for the purposes of demonstration.

105
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,760
So I leave it at one

106
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,150
next we're going to choose load balancing.

107
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,580
We're going to choose application load balancer

108
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,900
and create a new load balancer.

109
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,260
I'm going to call it my dash pcs

110
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,760
dash lb.

111
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,410
It's gonna listen on port 80 protocol http.

112
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,460
I'm going to create a target group.

113
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,450
My dash e C S T G

114
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,560
protocol is going to be http.

115
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,170
Health check path

116
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,770
is simply a slash

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,550
and the health check grace period is 30.

118
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,430
Now you can use existing low balances and target groups.

119
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,120
It does become a little bit more tricky getting the settings correct.

120
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,350
So it's often easier just to create it through here.

121
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,350
So those settings look good.

122
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,910
Let's check the networking for networking we have

123
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,060
the same configuration so that looks good to me.

124
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,760
Let's click on deploy

125
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,890
so that's gonna take a few minutes because

126
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,460
it will create our application load balancer and our

127
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,050
target group and then a service and a task that's running on top of that service.

128
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,890
My service is now deployed successfully.

129
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,050
Let's go to ec two and see what's happened.

130
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,100
So in Ec two I go down to low balances.

131
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,660
I've got an A. L. B.

132
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,150
So that looks good.

133
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,760
I'm just gonna copy the DNS name here. We're gonna check that out in a moment.

134
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,760
So I've got my A L. B. In target groups we have a target group

135
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,980
note that it uses the I. P target type

136
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,060
for pcs containers running on the Ec. Two launch type

137
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,180
and under registered targets. You can see that we have a registered target.

138
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,260
So that's our task running on our cluster.

139
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,560
Now we do need to make sure that our security groups are set up correctly.

140
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,940
So I launched mine in the default VPc, which I can see is the one that finishes with

141
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
seven F 4.

142
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,210
So if I now go over and find the default

143
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,850
security group for that particular. VPc,

144
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,850
I need to just go in because that's a security group we use for our container,

145
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,500
I need to make sure that the inbound rule does allow http and I've got one.

146
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,060
If you don't have one, just edit inbound rules

147
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,360
at the rule

148
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,790
and choose http

149
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,510
and anywhere I p V four.

150
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,080
So mine is set up correctly.

151
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,080
So I'm going to go to a new tab paste in the DNS name for my A L. B.

152
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,560
And you can see that we are accessing our container.

153
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,640
So it just tells us welcome to Engine X.

154
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,990
So that's the container running on the service on top of our E C S cluster.

155
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,150
So that's all there is to it that is now running successfully.

156
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,910
So what I'm gonna do is go back, I'm finished with this particular exercise.

157
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,470
So what we can do

158
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,440
is we can go to our service

159
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,410
and we need to edit the service.

160
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,470
You won't be able to delete it when you have tasks running.

161
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,950
So you specify zero as desired tasks,

162
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,350
click on updates

163
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,460
that will update it and it should remove that task.

164
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,370
If we come back into tasks here we can see we do have one running

165
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,950
but that should go quite soon.

166
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,350
Then we can delete our service,

167
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,560
click on delete

168
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,180
and that's deleted to service. Now if we go back to have a look at R A L. B.

169
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,350
It should still be there.

170
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,980
So if we come back to A. L. B, you'll note that it doesn't delete that for you.

171
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,620
So make sure you go back and clean that up, delete your A. L. B.

172
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,820
Once that's gone successfully.

173
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,230
You can go and delete your target group if you wish

174
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,960
to or you can keep that doesn't cost you anything.

175
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,760
I'm gonna delete my target group

176
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,430
and then I'm going to go to instances

177
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:58,460
and here I have my Ec two instance running, I'm going to terminate my instance as well

178
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,860
and that's really cleared up anything that's gonna cost us any money.

179
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,560
So that's shutting down.

180
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,280
You can leave the cluster,

181
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,770
it won't cost you anything if you're not running the container

182
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,440
instances or you can just go and delete your cluster as well

183
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,860
and that's it for this lesson.
