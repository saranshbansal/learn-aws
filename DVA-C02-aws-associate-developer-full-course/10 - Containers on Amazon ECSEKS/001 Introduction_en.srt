Welcome to this section.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,360
In this section,

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,520
I'm going to cover the amazon elastic container service (ECS) as well as

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,240
the elastic kubernetes service e k s and the elastic container registry (ECR)

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:20,410
So these are all services related to running and managing Docker containers on AWS

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,610
amazon Ec s is a service we can use for running docker containers on AWS,

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,960
either in a serverless manner or with

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,560
the underlying infrastructure within our control.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,510
Then elastic kubernetes service is used for management of containers.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,400
You might be using Kubernetes in your on premises data center or on another cloud.

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,760
EKS allows us to run a managed implementation of Kubernetes in the cloud.

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,980
And then, lastly,

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,820
the elastic container registry is where we can

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,850
actually store the images for our containers.

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,560
So all about containers in this section,

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,960
exciting technology and certainly interesting to learn about and to use.
