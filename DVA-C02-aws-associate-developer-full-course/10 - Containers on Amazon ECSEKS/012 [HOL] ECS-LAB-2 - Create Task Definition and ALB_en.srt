00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,270
Hi guys and welcome to part two of the U C S lab in

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,570
this lesson we're going to create the

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,750
task definition and the application load balancer.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,930
We're really building the building blocks for our cluster

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,960
and service that will create in the next lesson.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,770
So in the CS will create a task definition. We're gonna do that via the command line.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,860
We're going to then create an application load balancer.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,750
It's gonna have to listeners the primary on Port 80 for our active application

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,720
and then a secondary testing listener on port 80 80.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,490
And you'll see when we get to the next section

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,640
of the course where we finish off this lab exercise,

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,270
we add in a codepipeline and you'll see how

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,940
we could use codedeploy to automatically swap the ports

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,760
the listeners rather and also the target groups when we do a blue green deployment.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,160
So for now this is what we're going to build out.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,280
Now, back in the file, you will see that we're on part two now.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,680
So we've got some instructions,

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,770
you need to change to a command line on your computer with pcs permission.

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,100
So just run AWS configure, make sure you've got access keys configured for that,

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,650
give you permissions to e c s

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,660
and then we're gonna change to the directory with task def dot Jason.

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,650
You'll see that in a moment.

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,620
Now, before we actually do any of this,

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,000
we need to update this file.

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,840
So this is the file,

26
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,050
you'll find it of course in your code directory amazon ec s

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,330
and you'll see there's an execution role and that's

28
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,530
not set up correctly at this point in time.

29
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,720
So I don't have my account number in there

30
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,760
but this role should exist. If it doesn't in your account

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,830
then you can just search on google for creating

32
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,740
the tcs task execution role copy and paste that.

33
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,470
You will find the instructions.

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,640
It's very simple but you should have it because we've already been using E C.

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,060
S and it creates it for us.

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,210
So what I'm gonna do is just grab my account number and

37
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,660
put it into here and then we should be ready to go.

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,780
So I've copied my account number in.

39
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,620
You'll see that the task definition name is sample dash website. It's an engine.

40
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,310
X image. It's going to use poor 80 because it's a web service.

41
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,760
It's gonna have fargate capabilities,

42
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,340
the AWS VPc network mode

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,350
and then 256 CPU and 5 12 of memory.

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,620
So I'm happy with that. I'm gonna save my file

45
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,590
and back in the instructions here. I'm gonna copy this command.

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,720
So this is for registering the task definition

47
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,760
and let's head over to a command line.

48
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,970
So on the command line you should be in your pcs directory that's in your code,

49
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,460
download wherever you put that on your computer

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,010
and what you should find in here is you have the task def dot Jason file.

51
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,140
So if I just open that file

52
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,380
we can see the file we just

53
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,260
configured.

54
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,000
So let's clear the screen come down to the middle

55
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,860
and I'm gonna try and register my task definition.

56
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,060
That looks good. It has registered the task definition for me.

57
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,860
So let's go back over to our file

58
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,070
and see what we need to do next.

59
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,360
So now we're going to create the application load balancer,

60
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,240
you can see the various settings that we need to

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,070
create here so you can refer back to this.

62
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,660
I'm going to go to the console now and configure according to these settings.

63
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,910
So in the console, in the Ec two management console,

64
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,910
I'm going to go down to low balances.

65
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,060
Let's click on load balancer, create a load balancer

66
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,050
and click on create under application load balancer.

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,670
Let's call this

68
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,510
my E C S dash

69
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,560
A or B.

70
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,950
It's going to be internet facing.

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,960
It's gonna use IPV four,

72
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,850
it's going to be in the default VPc.

73
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,180
We can select the subnets. So what I would do is choose two subnets that are public.

74
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,440
So I'm just going to choose us East one a and one b.

75
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,050
We can then scroll down under security groups.

76
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,700
You can choose a security group that's in your default VPc.

77
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,620
That's going to give you the correct ports.

78
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,110
I'm gonna choose my web access security group and we'll go and check that

79
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,560
out in a moment and make sure that it has the relevant ports open

80
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,910
next for listeners.

81
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,850
We want to add an additional listener.

82
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,360
But first we've got to create our target group for this one.

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,250
So it's great target group.

84
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,560
We're going to choose iP addresses,

85
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,560
The target group name. I'm going to paste in Target Group one.

86
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,060
It's going to listen on ports 80. So the containers are on port 80

87
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,250
it's going to be in the same VPc. Of course

88
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,400
we leave the remaining defaults

89
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,810
and we can go down, click on next,

90
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,670
scroll down again

91
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,360
and create target group.

92
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,800
So that's that created. Let's go back to here. We should be able to refresh.

93
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,650
We should be able to find our target group.

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
Let's add another listener.

95
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,350
Now it's also going to be HTTP but of course it needs to be a different ports.

96
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,260
So this will be 80, 80

97
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,460
and we're going to create our second target group

98
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,160
safe. Right. Second target group,

99
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,200
what we're gonna do is also choose I P addresses.

100
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,060
We're going to call it target group-2.

101
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,200
Support will be 80, 80

102
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,850
and the remaining settings are going to be left

103
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,960
as defaults.

104
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,260
Let's create that target group.

105
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,410
So we now have our two target groups.

106
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,760
Let's go back to the wizard where we're adding our second listener,

107
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,060
make sure we refresh and we should find target group too.

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,660
So that's set up

109
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,560
and now we can simply scroll down to the bottom and create our load balancer

110
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,130
and that's been created for us. So we now have our application load balancer.

111
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,640
You should see your listener configuration like this.

112
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,980
So you've got the http port 80 listener going to target group one.

113
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,510
So it's forwarding any connections to target Group one then 80

114
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,150
80 is the second listener going to target group too.

115
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,240
So that's the way that should look make sure

116
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,310
that your target groups are set up correctly.

117
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,750
So we've added using the I. P. Target type. That's very important

118
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,310
And that should be the same for both.

119
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,660
And of course the poor is 8080 on target group too

120
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,460
And 80 on Target Group one.

121
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,040
So if you've got all those settings then that's it for this lesson.

122
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,050
And what we're going to do in the next lesson is continue by creating our

123
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,950
Fargate cluster and service that's going to use

124
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,060
this load balancer and our task definition.
