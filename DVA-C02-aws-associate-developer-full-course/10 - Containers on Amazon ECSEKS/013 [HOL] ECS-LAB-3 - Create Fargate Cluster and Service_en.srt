00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,520
Hi guys and welcome to E C S lab Part three in this lesson,

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,800
we're going to create our Fargate cluster and a service

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,059
and we're going to leverage the components we've already created,

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,690
including our image in our pcr repository,

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,250
our task definition in e C s and our application load balancer.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,870
So this is where we are.

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,430
We have our task definition and our load balancer with our target groups

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,980
in this lesson, we'll create the Fargate cluster, we'll create the E C S service

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,140
and we're going to run a task and that task is going to be based off our task definition

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,460
and our task definition of course is going to use the image in the repository.

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,450
So it's configured to pull the image from

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,960
the CCR private repository that we created earlier.

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,760
So let's head back over to the instructions and see what we need to do.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,760
So in the instructions were now on part

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,550
three here create Fargate cluster and service.

16
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,459
We need to go and create our Fargate cluster.

17
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,950
Now I'm going to call it this particular name.

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,080
My C E C S lab cluster with some dashes in the middle.

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,660
So in the CS management console I'm going to create a new cluster.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,060
I'm going to paste in my cluster name

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,400
for networking.

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,970
What I want to do is remember we actually specified us

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,610
East one A and one B for our load balancer.

24
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:32,050
So I'm just going to remove the other subnets so that I only end up with A and B.

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,220
So it moves them around a little.

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,170
So watch out which ones you remove or you can always add them back in again. Very easy.

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,760
So I've now got one A and one B.

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Now this is going to use the Fargate type so this is going to use serverless.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,200
We're gonna leave that selected of course you can't change it

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,360
anyway but we don't need to select either of these options

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,540
and we're just gonna create our cluster so that will just take a moment to create.

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,960
Now back in our file here, we can see that the next thing we need to do

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,580
is we need to change on the command line to

34
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,010
a directory with the create service dot Jason file.

35
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,560
And we're going to run these two commands. Now let's have a look at this file.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,660
This is gonna take a little bit of work to set up.

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,200
So here is the file.

38
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,060
Now make sure first

39
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,160
that your cluster name is set up correctly.

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,170
So it needs to be

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,050
my e CS lab cluster if you've copied

42
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,460
the same as me,

43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,560
we then got our task definition here.

44
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,100
So let's go to E C s and check what our task definition is called.

45
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,200
So back in the CS let's go to task definitions and sure enough we have this E C S

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,550
lab and if I click on it then the revision is that it's ccs dash lab colon one.

47
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,160
So here it was called the CS Demo. So I'm just going to change that CCS Lab one

48
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,020
and it's got the correct

49
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,160
cluster name

50
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,980
Next we need to get the A R N. For our load balancer so we need to paste that into here.

51
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,550
That's gonna be the A R N for our primary target group.

52
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,960
So let's head back over to ec two.

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,710
I'm gonna come scroll down on the left here to target groups

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,660
and I'm gonna copy the A. R. N. Of target group one

55
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,130
and I'm gonna paste that into my file.

56
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,370
Next we have our launch type. That's fine. Replica is fine.

57
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,770
The deployment controller, we're going to use codedeploy a bit later on.

58
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,660
So that's all correct. The only other things we need to change A here.

59
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,690
So the Sub Net I D s and the security group I. D.

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,090
So the sub net idea,

61
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,680
let's head over to the VPC management console and we want to find the I

62
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,740
D S for RV Pcs are subnets within us East one A and one B.

63
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,650
So I'm in the VPC management console. Let's go to subnets

64
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,400
And what we're looking for. I know that these ones with a tag on them with a name.

65
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:59,950
Those are in my custom VPC. And so what I'm looking for our us East one a

66
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,390
and one B.

67
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,860
And I know that these subnets are the ones from my default VPC.

68
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,900
So I can simply copy the sub net I D. From here. That's us East one

69
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,660
A

70
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,240
back in my file here. I'm simply going to paste that in. So I've got the first Sub net I.

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,720
D.

72
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,220
Let's then find

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,350
us east one B.

74
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,250
And I want to make sure it's the one,

75
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,080
this is the one here. So let's just follow that across.

76
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,860
So this is now my Sub Net I. D. For my

77
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,040
subnets in the default VPc. And US East one B. So I'm gonna copy that Sub Net I. D.

78
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,950
Back in the file. Let's just paste that in.

79
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,710
And the last thing that I want to do

80
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,050
is find my security group ID.

81
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,360
So what I'm going to do now is go to security groups,

82
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,860
we use the web access security group and that is in the default VPc.

83
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,230
So I'm gonna just find the security group I. D. Here.

84
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,720
Let's just copy that or I can copy it from here. That's probably better.

85
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,470
So copy my security group I. D. Let's come back and let's paste that in.

86
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,160
So that file is now set up correctly. I'm gonna save that file.

87
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,390
Let's go back to our instructions so we can see that we now have this

88
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,960
command to run.

89
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,630
Everything should be correct in that command. I don't need to change anything.

90
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,240
They're back on the command line so of course I'm in the directory in the code E. C. S.

91
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,960
And in here I should have that file so create dash service dot Jason.

92
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,370
So now I can run this command

93
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,760
and that looks like it's worked successfully. So we should now have a service

94
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,060
that's going to run,

95
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,940
let's go back to the Ec two management console and see how that looks.

96
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,460
So back in the CS under clusters,

97
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,200
I'm going to choose my CS lab cluster

98
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,760
and we can see I have a service here

99
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,430
and if I click on that service it's gonna give

100
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,050
me quite a bit of information about the service.

101
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,260
Now the other thing I can do

102
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,970
is I can actually go back up to my cluster level,

103
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,850
let's go to tasks and we should see we have a running task

104
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,040
and that task has a public I. P. So I can go straight to that task

105
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,160
and we can see engine X is actually working.

106
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,010
And then also if I come back to load balances,

107
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,660
let's copy the DNS name of my load balancer

108
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,590
and check that we can access here. So that looks good.

109
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,050
And you know,

110
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,770
if you don't get if you get it timing

111
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,220
out then your security groups aren't set up correctly.

112
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,040
But this is what you should see now that's all working correctly,

113
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,850
which means everything that we've run has worked.

114
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,950
Now the other command here which does have the

115
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,860
cluster nine minutes to make sure that's correct.

116
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,340
This just helps you to describe services on the command line.

117
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,670
So if you want to run that one,

118
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,520
it's just another way of retrieving this information on the cli

119
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,880
so that's it for the E C. S. Lab in this section.

120
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,950
But we're gonna leave things running so don't destroy anything.

121
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,180
Leave it running and we're gonna pick it up in the next section.

122
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,940
So between now and then you're going to learn a bit about the developer tools.

123
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,360
The various developer tools including a codecommit codepipeline and codedeploy.

124
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,780
And there's also going to be a few more hands

125
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,860
on lessons before we get back to this where you're

126
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,220
going to start learning some of the building blocks of

127
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,770
codepipeline codecommit and codebuild as well using elastic beanstalk.

128
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,740
But do leave this running and hopefully if you

129
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,450
can get to this fairly soon you know it's

130
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,660
not gonna be running for too long and it should mostly be within the free tier as well.

131
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,840
So hope you enjoyed this so far.

132
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,550
Leave things running and we'll pick it up in the next section.
