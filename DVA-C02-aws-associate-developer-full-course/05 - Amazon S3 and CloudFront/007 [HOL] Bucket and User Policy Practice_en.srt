1
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:09,856
In this lesson, we're going to work with user policies and bucket policies

2
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:12,800
to control access to Amazon S3.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,040
Now, there are a few things you need to do for this particular lesson.

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,960
So we already have this bucket we created before.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,850
Now, what I am going to do is go back to permissions, click on edit,

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,930
and I'm going to restore the block all public access.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,860
So I don't actually want any public access to this bucket.

8
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:33,950
Let's click on confirm.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,550
That's done.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,750
If I come back to objects, we have our objects here.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,050
And I go to permissions.

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,180
What we'll find is now that we've done that, it's removed

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,650
that ACL that allowed read access. So that's great.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,350
So let's come back and what I'm going to do is go back up to the bucket level

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,800
and I'm going to create a couple of folders.

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,250
One is going to be called confidential.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,060
Let's create that folder.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,960
Create one more folder.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,230
And this one will be called department.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,000
And let's create that folder.

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,550
So now we have these two folders and one image.

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,100
So next I want to go back to the management console,

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,070
go to users,

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,850
we've got the second account called Paul.

25
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,620
And I just want to make sure that Paul doesn't have any permission.

26
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,550
So we don't have any groups assigned to Paul

27
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,660
and we don't have any policies applied to Paul. So that's great.

28
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,596
And you'll need to go and log in as Paul in a separate browser window.

29
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:38,660
So use a private window so that you can still stay logged in as yourself as well.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,520
So I'm logged in as Paul.

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,350
And if I click on S3,

32
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,360
what we should find is that we don't have any permissions.

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,030
That's exactly what we should expect.

34
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,330
Now, you'll find this file in your course, downloads so go to the code directory,

35
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,660
Amazon S3 and then user policies and bucket policies.

36
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,170
Now this first policy statement here

37
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,370
simply allows the action S3 list all my buckets

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,350
and it uses this wild card, so this is any S3 bucket.

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,740
So let's just copy this code to our clipboard.

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,160
And back where I'm logged in as myself, under Paul's account

41
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,060
I'm going to add an in-line policy.

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,560
Go to JSON.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,490
I'm going to copy over the top of this code,

44
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,060
paste my code in,

45
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,560
click on review.

46
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:24,160
We'll give it a name,

47
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,060
and then create the policy.

48
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:27,756
So that's done.

49
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,260
Now let's go back to where we logged in as Paul.

50
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,450
Here, I'm going to simply click refresh.

51
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:36,370
and now we can actually see the bucket.

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,490
But it's still saying insufficient permissions so we can

53
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,500
list it but we can't really do anything else.

54
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,690
If I click on the bucket name,

55
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,850
I can't see any of the objects including the folders inside the bucket.

56
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,410
So back in my JSON file, what I'm going to do now is use this second user policy.

57
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,360
So this one allows us to see the root level bucket items.

58
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,010
Now, we do need to add something in here, so we need to add in the bucket name.

59
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,250
So let's go back and get the ARN of our bucket.

60
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,060
So back in S3, let's click on properties next to our bucket,

61
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,460
copy the ARN.

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,860
And then in my policy here I'm just going to paste it over the top here.

63
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,650
So now I have that policy configured.

64
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,160
So I'm going to copy that to my clipboard.

65
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,150
And back in IAM,

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,960
what I'm going to do is just click on this policy, expand, edit,

67
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,750
go to JSON, and then we'll copy the code over the top.

68
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,000
So this policy is going to allow us to list all the buckets in the account.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,530
So, with the wild card for the resource

70
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,200
and then it's going to allow us to list

71
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,960
the contents of the bucket for this specific bucket.

72
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,280
So let's review this policy.

73
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,560
Click on save.

74
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,750
Come back to where Paul's logged in.

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,760
I'm going to refresh.

76
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,570
Just give it a couple of refreshes

77
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,460
and now I can actually see the contents of the bucket.

78
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,050
Now, we don't have anything in here yet, but if I go in I can't find anything.

79
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,251
So let's go back and what I'm going to do, under S3,

80
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:12,460
I am actually going to add some content into those folders.

81
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,950
So let's go to confidential.

82
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:15,500
I'm going to upload,

83
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,149
add files, add my confidential report,

84
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:21,523
upload.

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,960
Let's go back to the other folders and that's department.

86
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,310
Upload.

87
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,100
I'm going to add another file.

88
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,750
And this one is going to be just the company goals.

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,470
So let's upload that document.

90
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,730
And we now have some files. Now, that won't make any difference to Paul.

91
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,950
He still won't be able to see anything because there aren't any permissions to do so.

92
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,160
So back in our JSON file, what we're now going to do

93
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,750
is we're going to enable Paul to be able to view the department folder contents.

94
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,580
So now we're going to need to get the ARN again.

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,850
So let's go up and I've already got it here.

96
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,230
So I'm just going to copy this ARN.

97
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,900
We've got a couple of places to put this first.

98
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,260
We need to put it in here.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,560
So this is the list bucket, it's the same statement as before.

100
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,060
And then we also need it in here, this is the new statement that we're adding in now.

101
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,090
So this is going to allow the list bucket

102
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,391
for the specific resource which is the ARN of the bucket and then the department

103
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:28,650
folder and the contents, the /* means the contents of that folder.

104
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,850
So let's copy this user policy.

105
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,810
And I'm going to edit the policy for Paul again.

106
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,360
It's going to JSON.

107
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,760
Paste it in,

108
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,180
review,

109
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,140
and save and you get the odd warning here and there but it should work as expected.

110
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,300
So let's come back to Paul.

111
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,560
And Paul should now be able to see the contents of the department folder and he can.

112
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,971
Now, though Paul can see in this folder is he able to actually download

113
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:56,210
anything from the folder?

114
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,760
So let's try and download this file.

115
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,950
And we get an access denied.

116
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,190
Now what about uploading? Can Paul upload?

117
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,610
Let's try and add a file at the beach.JPEG.

118
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,383
Click on upload.

119
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,310
And again, we get an access denied.

120
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,460
So let's close that out

121
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,660
and let's go and enable those permissions for Paul.

122
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,050
So back in the JSON file, we have another user policy here.

123
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,660
What I'm going to do is just first update my ARN.

124
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,700
There's a few places to do this.

125
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,160
That's the first one.

126
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,500
Then there's this one here which allows us access to

127
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,960
the department folder contents to be able to list those contents.

128
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,878
And then we have this new statement here and I'm going to copy

129
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:43,370
over the top of the ARN making sure that I leave /department/*.

130
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,530
Now here we've got the S3 get object and S3 put objects api actions.

131
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,860
So those should allow us to retrieve, so download and also upload objects.

132
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,860
So I've copied my code.

133
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,810
And let's edit this policy again.

134
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,160
Click on JSON.

135
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,650
Paste it in,

136
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,460
review and save.

137
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,630
So coming back to where Paul's logged in, let's try and download this file.

138
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,216
And that worked, that happened on another screen.

139
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:14,760
So you can't see it but that did download successfully.

140
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,760
And now let's try and upload an object.

141
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,780
So let's add files. Trying to add the same image file as before.

142
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,060
Click on upload.

143
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,960
And that worked successfully.

144
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,980
The next policy is a bucket policy.

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,710
So what this will do is grant access to Paul to list the confidential folder

146
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,750
and we're going to use it with policy two above.

147
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,508
So this is going to show you that you can use a combination

148
00:07:39,532 --> 00:07:41,450
of bucket and user policies.

149
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,620
So firstly, let's go back and get the user policy number two.

150
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,990
So back at the top here, let's grab this policy. It's already configured for us.

151
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,950
And I'm going to go back in and edit this policy.

152
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,660
Save the policy.

153
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,550
And of course now

154
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,860
Paul will have access to view the bucket

155
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,060
but won't be able to see anything in the confidential folder.

156
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,460
Next we need the actual bucket policy here.

157
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,860
And so what we need to do is copy over the bucket name here.

158
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,560
And we also need Paul's ARN.

159
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,260
So back in IAM, I'm going to copy the ARN for Paul's user account

160
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,450
and then paste that in here.

161
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,560
Then let's copy the code.

162
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,750
And this is going to be a bucket policy.

163
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,179
So back in S3, let's go up to the bucket level,

164
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:40,650
go to permissions, and let's add a bucket policy, so we click on edit right here.

165
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,760
Remove all this code,

166
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,560
paste this code in,

167
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,540
and make sure that you've got the ARNs correct.

168
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,880
And then save changes.

169
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,950
Now let's go back to Paul

170
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,630
And let's see if Paul can actually see the objects in the confidential folder.

171
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,960
And that all works.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,050
So that's just a simple demonstration of using user policies to provide access to S3

173
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:08,755
and also bucket policies.

174
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,960
And of course we can use them in combination as well.

175
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,020
So I hope that worked well for you. I will see you in the next lesson.
