1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,370
The amazon Simple storage service,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,730
amazon S three is an object based storage system and it features

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,960
in many different AWS exams is one of the fundamental AWS technologies

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:12,740
now.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,450
It does feature quite a lot on the DVA exam,

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,790
so there's quite a few particular topics

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,820
that are very important to understand for the

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,140
exam and that's all gonna be covered in lots of detail in this section.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,100
So quite a lot of coverage of amazon S three. Then we look at cloudfront as well.

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,560
So Cloudfront is a content delivery network at CDN.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,640
That means it caches media assets like video,

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,160
files and images and all sorts of different types of files around

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,950
the world to get them closer to end users for better performance.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,370
So we're going to be looking at Cloudfront in a

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,590
little bit of detail to understand how it works,

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,560
what the benefits are and what settings you need to understand for the exam.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,860
So that's it for now, enjoy the section, I'll see you in the next lesson.
