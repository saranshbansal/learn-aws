Hi guys. In this lesson we're going to use presigned URLs.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,210
And what we're going to do with a pre-signed URL

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,303
is you're going to see how we can actually add an object to a bucket

4
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:19,481
that's not publicly accessible and then give someone a URL that

5
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:22,460
can make it accessible to them without authentication.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,590
We're going to use the CLI to actually run a command to create our presigned URL.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,860
So this is the command that we're going to run. It will generate a presigned URL.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,000
The response will look something like this.

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,010
So we're actually then going to have this information returned

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,340
and this is the URL that we're able to then use to access the objects.

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,430
And it actually has some information about expiry in here.

12
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,210
So you can see it says expires in 3,600 seconds.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm back in S3.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,850
And what I'm going do is I have this beach JPG in my bucket.

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,640
So I'm going to select this object, click on object URL.

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,676
Let's go to a new window and let's try and access that.

17
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:09,950
Now, I just want to make sure that I cannot access it and that is exactly the case.

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,580
So it's not publicly accessible.

19
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,560
We did make an object publicly accessible earlier on

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,790
in this section but we then removed those permissions.

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,560
So make sure that you don't have any bucket policies

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,540
specified and you don't have the block public access disabled.

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,676
So it should be on.

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,550
So we now know that we can't access this object.

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,960
So what we're going to do is see how we can make

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,050
this available to us using a presigned URL.

27
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,180
So I'm going to take the bucket name,

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,750
copy it to my clipboard,

29
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:50,000
on a command line I'm going to type AWS S3 presign then S3://

30
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,560
provide the bucket name,

31
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,460
and then I'm going to provide the file name.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,060
Now, I also need to specify my profile information for my account.

33
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,460
So that should be it. That should be all I need to specify. I just hit enter.

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,699
And this is the URL that I'm now going to use, so I can copy this to my clipboard.

35
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,850
Let's come back to our browser window here

36
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,960
and I'm going to paste this one in.

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,150
And now we can see this nice image.

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,630
So that's it. That's how a presigned URL works.

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,650
And once the 3,600 seconds expire, I will no longer be able to access this object.
