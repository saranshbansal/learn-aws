00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,130
Hi guys, In this lesson, we're going to work with Access Control Lists.

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,680
I'm back in the S3 management console.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,670
And we already created this bucket before.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,650
Now in my bucket, I have this file, it's a jpeg image.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,440
Now if I select the image, we'll see that I have an object URL.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,910
Now let's see what happens if I try to go to that object URL.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,960
So I'm just going to paste it into a web page here.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,840
And what you'll see is we get this access denied error message.

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,820
So we can't actually access that object.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,860
Now, one of the ways that we can access the object is if we update the ACL.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,350
Now, ACLs are configured in a couple of places.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,660
So firstly, if we go to permissions for the bucket, so now I'm at the bucket level,

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,060
and we scroll down, now, note, we do have block public access on.

14
00:00:56,836 --> 00:00:59,320
But if you scroll down a little bit further, you'll see here,

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,860
we've got Access Control Lists.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,550
Now, let's click on edit.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,160
And you can see the settings you can apply.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,840
Now there's only a few grantees, so you have an option of applying

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,530
Access Control List permissions to the bucket owner,

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,200
to everyone, so public access,

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,900
to authenticated users group, so that's anyone with an AWS account who's logged in,

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,130
and the S3 log delivery group and also other accounts.

23
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,930
So you can add a grantee and specify the canonical idea of another account.

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,010
And that means anyone coming from that

25
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,540
account will have whatever permissions you apply.

26
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,570
So these are the settings. Now it's not a huge amount.

27
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,990
I know sometimes in the documentation refers to how ACLs are very granular.

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,570
But of course this is nothing like as granular

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,640
as using bucket policies or user policies.

30
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,020
So when you apply a bucket policy you have all the power

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,360
of using JSON code and all the various different options we can configure

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,900
such as configuring whether we're allowing people access based on the IP address,

33
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,860
they're coming from, that kind of thing.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,220
So you get a lot more granularity with bucket policies than you do with ACLs.

35
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,990
So with an ACL, we might want to for example, allow public access.

36
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,540
So here we can say well, for objects I'm going to enable list access.

37
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,460
If you want people to be able to see the bucket ACL, you can enable read here.

38
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,320
Now note the other options are actually grayed out.

39
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,580
Now, the console is warning us that by configuring these settings,

40
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,250
anyone in the world will be able to access these objects.

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,860
I'm okay with that. So I'm going to click I understand.

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,800
So let's see what happens when I try and save my changes.

43
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,630
I opened this up so I need to remove that. And let's try and save those changes.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,650
Now I'm not able to.

45
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,200
And the reason for this

46
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,860
is because we still have that block public access setting on.

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,450
So it's not going to allow me to make these changes. So let's cancel out there.

48
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,640
Click on edit under block public access.

49
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,130
Deselect this option, click on save.

50
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,460
We need to confirm.

51
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,340
And those settings were applied.

52
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,260
And now we can go back to the ACL.

53
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,970
Click on list for everyone,

54
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,840
accept it, and click on save changes and now it works.

55
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,820
So we've done that. Does that mean that we can now come back and access our object?

56
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:19,943
Let's refresh.

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,970
And no it doesn't. We still have an access denied.

58
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,560
So we've enabled that setting at the bucket level,

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,000
but what we haven't done is we haven't enabled

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,150
it actually at the object level as well.

61
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,540
So if I click back on this object and go to permissions,

62
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,400
you'll see that here there are no permissions for public access.

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,050
So if I want to enable public access, I need to enable read here.

64
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,160
Again, I need to confirm it.

65
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,570
Come down, click on save changes.

66
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,230
Now let's go back to our objects,

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,850
click on refresh.

68
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,650
And this time we get a nice image.

69
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,060
So that's how we can work with ACL. So key things to remember are ACLs

70
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,240
they're not particularly granular as you can

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,130
see there's just a few different grantees.

72
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,190
It's different at the object level versus the bucket level.

73
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:10,460
But you only have a few different options.

74
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,480
So you can use these for certain use cases such as enabling public access.

75
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,839
They're really good for that.

76
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,370
They're also quite good for enabling cross account access.

77
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,060
The other thing to remember is that they are different between the object level

78
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,120
and the bucket level.

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,350
So sometimes you have to specify the settings in multiple places.

80
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,460
Okay, so that's it for this lesson and I'll see you in the next one.
