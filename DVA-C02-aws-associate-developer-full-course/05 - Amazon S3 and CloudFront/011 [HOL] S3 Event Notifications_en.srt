1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,840
In this lesson, we're going to use Amazon S3 event notifications.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,950
What we're going to do is create an

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,458
event notification that triggers an email using SNS

4
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:18,080
whenever objects are uploaded to our bucket.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,850
Now, the first thing we need to do is create our SNS topic.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,050
So in the Simple Notification Service, I'm going to create a new topic,

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,660
choose standard,

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,060
give it a name,

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,150
and then I'm going to scroll down a little way and create this topic.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,880
Then I'm going to go to subscriptions

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,160
and I'm going to create a subscription to my topic.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,650
Choose the ARN,

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,820
select the protocol,

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,320
here I'm going to choose email.

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,890
And for endpoint, I'm going to give it my email address.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,660
Then I need to go to my email and confirm the subscription so that it starts working.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,580
We now need to configure the access policy for our topics. So I've gone to topics.

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,950
I've selected the name of my topic and here we can see the access policy.

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,560
Now what I want to do here is I simply want to copy

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,480
the resource ARN. That's all I need.

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,426
Then I'm going to come to this file here which is in the course download,

22
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,520
Amazon S3 and it's called S3 Event Notification.

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,650
What I need to do is paste the topic ARN

24
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,900
next to resource.

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,560
I'm then going to take the account number which is this piece here

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,250
and I'm going to paste it down here where it says bucket owner account ID.

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,590
And then lastly I need the ARN for my bucket.

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,190
So I've pasted the ARN for my bucket

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,450
and now I can simply copy all of this code.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,550
And back in SNS I'm going to click on edit for the topic.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,260
Come down to access policy again,

32
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,750
and let's just delete all of this code, paste my code in,

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,120
click on save changes.

34
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:05,340
So what we've just done is we've granted the SNS publish API action to the S3 service

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,350
for a specific resource which is the SNS topic

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,890
and then the ARN for the bucket.

37
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,850
So anything coming from this bucket with this account number is going to be allowed

38
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,750
the SNS public API action. So those are the permissions we need.

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,960
Now we can go back to S3 and create our event notification.

40
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,190
So back in S3, on the properties page for my bucket,

41
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,250
I'm going to scroll down a little way,

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,860
find event notifications, click create event notification,

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,260
give it a name.

44
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,405
You can optionally specify a prefix or suffix to apply this to.

45
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:46,860
I'm going to leave those blank.

46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,710
I'm going to select all objects create events.

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,800
That's Put, Post, Copy, and multipart uploads.

48
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,450
Let's scroll down a little way

49
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,690
and now we get to choose

50
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:04,100
the destination so we can choose Lambda functions, SNS topics, or SQS queues.

51
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,160
So we're going to choose topic.

52
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,480
I'm going to choose the Email-Me topic I just created

53
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,260
and then save changes.

54
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,830
So that's all there is to it.

55
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,040
Now if you did get any access denied issues when you were trying to save then

56
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,030
that's because you haven't properly specified those permissions in SNS.

57
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,311
So just go back to that policy we created and make sure that you have correctly

58
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:30,550
specified the ARNs for your bucket,

59
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,660
for your topic as well, and also the account number.

60
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,490
So now what we're going to do is go to objects

61
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,380
and just upload an object.

62
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,750
Doesn't matter what it is. So I'm just going to upload the file.

63
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,360
Click on upload,

64
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:45,740
and upload.

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,560
And now I can go over to my email inbox and see what's been delivered.

66
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,260
And this is what turned up in my email inbox.

67
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,070
Here we can see an event notification that's just told us

68
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,100
an event has happened, and clearly there's quite a bit of information in here.

69
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,400
Things like the region, the event time, what type of EPI

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,050
action was actually initiated.

71
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,660
So this was a PUT operation, an object-created operation.

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,425
We can see the principal ID, so who actually performed this, what IP address

73
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,459
they came from and much, much more.

74
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,399
So that's really useful information that could be

75
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,860
then used by another service to process that information in some way.

76
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,680
So that's it for this lesson.

77
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,710
And if you are going to be uploading lots of objects to this bucket,

78
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,660
make sure you go back and delete your

79
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,350
event notification or you're going to get lots of emails.
