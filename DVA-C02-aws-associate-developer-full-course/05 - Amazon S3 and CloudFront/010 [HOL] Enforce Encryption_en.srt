1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,776
In this lesson we're going to look at how we can use a bucket policy

2
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:13,260
in order to enforce encryption for objects that are uploaded to the bucket.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,878
Now, we're going to use this policy here.

4
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:20,405
And I've already copied the ARN of my bucket to my clipboard

5
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,172
and I'm going to paste that in and make sure that the /* is still on the end.

6
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:29,930
So just do that and then you can copy this code to your clipboard.

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,960
And back in S3, I'm going to go to permissions,

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,560
come down to where my bucket policy is, click on edit,

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,060
and we're going to override this policy here.

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,410
This policy is going to deny all principals

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,360
the S3 PUT objects API action, so you can't upload objects

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,060
to this resource so this bucket and any object within the bucket.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,050
And there's a condition in the condition is that this value is null.

14
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,150
Now this value is XMZ server-side encryption true.

15
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,410
Now if that is specified, that means the object is going to be encrypted.

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,100
If it's null then you're trying to upload an object that isn't encrypted.

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,760
And in that case this policy will apply and you'll be denied.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,780
So let's save those changes.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,870
Come back to objects,

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,150
click on upload,

21
00:01:23,596 --> 00:01:24,660
add files.

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,150
Let's try uploading this mountain image. And if we come down to properties,

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,750
this is where we can specify encryption if we want to.

24
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,360
So let's try not specifying encryption.

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,725
And what happens?

26
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, it fails. So we can't upload that object.

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,220
Now, we can also run commands. So we can run these commands.

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,660
What I'm going to do is copy the bucket name to my clipboard,

29
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,680
paste it in here where it says your bucket name.

30
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,760
And now we have this command.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,860
Now we need to specify our own file name, so mine is called mountain.jpg.

32
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,650
And then I can copy this command to my clipboard.

33
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,080
So this command is essentially trying to do exactly

34
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,008
the same as we just did through the console.

35
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,160
So if I come to a location here where I have this file,

36
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,900
and I'm going to try and run this command with my profile specified.

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,030
And of course, we get an access denied just as before.

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,880
The next command we can run to try and actually get around this issue

39
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,450
is using the AWS S3 API CLI.

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,460
And then we can specify service side encryption using the command line.

41
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,060
Now, I need to copy the name of my file into two locations here for the body

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,850
and for the key.

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,650
So let's paste that one in.

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,620
Then I need to copy my bucket name

45
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,270
and put that here next to the --bucket.

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,260
Now I can copy this entire command.

47
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,460
Let's paste that in. I'm going to specify my profile information.

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,760
And let's try and upload this file.

49
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,660
And this time it succeeds.

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,290
So now we know that the S3 bucket policy is enforcing encryption and this is

51
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,460
how we can actually ensure that our objects are encrypted using the command line.

52
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,320
Now back in the console, we could also achieve this by adding a file.

53
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,560
Let's add a different file this time.

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,100
Click on upload.

55
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,750
And under properties,

56
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,590
I'm going to scroll down.

57
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,160
I'm going to specify an encryption key and I'll

58
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,960
just use the Amazon S3 managed keys option

59
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:31,370
and then upload.

60
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,350
And again that's going to work.

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,370
Now another thing you can do to make this a bit easier is go to properties,

62
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,700
and let's enable default encryption.

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,680
So now I'm going to specify enable.

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,450
Default encryption is going to be using S3 managed keys.

65
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,150
Let's save those changes.

66
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,850
So now we actually have the default encryption specified,

67
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,060
but we also do have this bucket policy so let's remove our bucket policy.

68
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,390
I just need to delete this policy

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,660
because that's going to enforce us to set certain settings for encryption.

70
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,260
So I've deleted the bucket policy.

71
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,610
We have enabled default encryption.

72
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,471
Now let's see what happens if I try and upload a file without specifying

73
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:15,960
any encryption information.

74
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,560
So I'm going to upload this file. Let's go to properties.

75
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,650
Let's make sure that we have not specified encryption settings.

76
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,010
And then let's click on upload.

77
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,740
And this time it does succeed despite the fact that we didn't actually

78
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,060
enable any encryption settings. And if we click on the file here,

79
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,951
we can see the information relating to this file and down here we can see

80
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:42,060
that the server-side encryption is actually enabled through default encryption.

81
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,810
So that's how we can use bucket policies to enforce encryption,

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,960
and we can use default encryption to automatically encrypt objects in our bucket.
