00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,280
In this quick video, I just want to discuss a couple of options to getting hands-on practice.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,920
Now, whatever technology you're learning, there's no substitute for getting hands-on practice actually

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,180
using the technology.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,950
it really is the best way to learn.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,260
Now, in this course, I recommend you open your own AWS free tier account.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,980
But there's another additional tool that might be useful called a Sandbox.

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,020
So let's start off with free tier.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,390
With the free tier, you're going to create your very own AWS free tier account, and I'm going to show

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,410
you how to do that.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,380
Now you get full control over this account. It's your account and that means you can do anything

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,490
you want with the account.

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,910
Now, this does mean that you're responsible for any bills.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,250
You'll need to add a credit card when you sign up for your free tier account and you'll have to pay

14
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,600
any bills that you run up.

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:01:00,140
Now, we will operate in the free tier in this course, and if we ever go outside of the free tier, I'm

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,780
going to warn you. But you always have to follow my instructions and make sure you shut down resources

17
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,740
to avoid bills.

18
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,200
And we're going to set a billing alarm, so you get a notification if you reach a certain threshold.

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:18,500
I highly recommend that you do open your own free tier account so you can follow along with my instructions

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,290
as we go through the course in the hands-on lessons.

21
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,700
An additional resource is known as a Sandbox or a Challenge Lab.

22
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,770
Now in this model, the AWS account is actually hosted by a provider,

23
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,940
it's not your account.

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,160
Now that does mean that you will have limited control. For more advanced courses

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,050
it means you won't be able to do things like cross account access because you'll only have one account

26
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,330
and you'll have limited control over it.

27
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,720
On the plus side, it means you get no cloud bills.

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:54,200
You don't take any risk or responsibility. You pay for the service upfront and there's no risk of running

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,520
up any additional bills.

30
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,840
With Challenge Labs

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,300
you get scenario-based challenges, so it's a great way to test your skills and learn new skills as

32
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,660
well

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,270
based on a scenario that's been pre-configured for you. It's been designed for you and the lab has

34
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,270
been set up to accommodate that particular challenge.

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,810
I recommend Challenge Labs as an additional training tool.

36
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,760
If you do want to gain access to Challenge Labs, then we actually have some on our website.

37
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,380
Now this is completely optional.

38
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,560
It's not required for this course, but it's an extra learning tool.

39
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,220
It does require registration and you have to pay an additional fee.

40
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:34,160
There's a video on this page to show what they look like in action, and in this particular example,

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,410
there were over 700 labs across many different cloud platforms and technologies.

42
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:45,950
Alternatively, if you're just learning AWS, you can access the AWS Challenge Labs. And you can see an example

43
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,430
here of the console. For those who are taking the SysOps exam,

44
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,880
this is what you'll see in your AWS exam lab.

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:00,080
This is the same provider that AWS used for their new exam labs. So you'll get the AWS management console

46
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,600
on the left and some instructions on the right. Or in the case of the exam or the more advanced labs,

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,230
you just get a scenario and a few hints as to what you need to do.

48
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,100
And it also verifies and validates the work that you've done.

49
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,170
So these are completely optional, but they're definitely a very useful tool for getting extra practice

50
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,150
and validating your own skills.
