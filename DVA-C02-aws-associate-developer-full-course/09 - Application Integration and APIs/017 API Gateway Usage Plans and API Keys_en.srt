00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,780
In this lesson, I'm going to cover usage plans and API keys.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,790
And I'll start off with a diagram to show you how we can use these two elements.

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,930
So let's say we have an API.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,490
And we've got two different classes of user.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,660
We've got our basic users and we've got our premium users who pay more money.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,980
So what we want to do here is we're going to create two different usage plans.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,720
One's called premium and one's called basic.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,620
And we're going to configure different settings for the different usage plans.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,400
So for example, the premium usage plan is going to have higher rates

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,270
and bursts enabled, so we're giving more throughput for the premium plan

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,090
and increasing the quotas for requests a minute.

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,160
So what happens then is we need to identify who our users are when they connect.

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,410
For that we use an API key.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,690
So the users connect the specific public endpoint with an API key that's configured

15
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,850
in a usage plan.

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,516
So they're both connected to the same endpoint

17
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:12,430
but they have different API keys included in their request.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,830
Then we can identify who they are and forward them on to different stages.

19
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,950
So here we have a production V1 stage and a V2 stage.

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,980
And then we might have different endpoints on the backend as well.

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,690
You can also configure per method throttling limits.

22
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,530
So you might have it at the method level as well as at the API level.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,283
Usage plans specify who can access one or more deployed API stages and methods

24
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,460
and how much and how fast they can access them.

25
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,720
You can use a usage plan to configure throttling and quota limits

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,710
which are then enforced on individual client API keys.

27
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,000
The plan uses the API keys to identify the API clients

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,310
so we know who they are and we can associate them

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,390
with the correct plan that we want to connect them to.

30
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,380
And it meters access to the associated API stages for each key.

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,729
It also lets you configure throttling limits

32
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,380
and quota limits that are enforced on those individual client API keys.

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Lastly, you can use API keys together with

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,040
usage plans or Lambda authorizers to control access to your APIs.
