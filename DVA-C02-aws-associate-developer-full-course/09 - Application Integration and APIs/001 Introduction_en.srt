00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,770
Welcome to this section in this section there's

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,340
coverage of quite a lot of different services.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,190
We're going to look at the application integration services,

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,130
we're going to look at some services

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,270
you can use for creating event driven architectures

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,079
as well as a P. I. S.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,720
So with the application integration services we have services

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,170
such as the amazon simple queue service sqs.

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,690
Now that's a really important one to understand for

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,230
the exam does come up in lots of questions,

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,430
so we've got quite a long theory lesson on SQS

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,150
and also it's covered in lots of hands on lessons.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,830
S and S. The simple notification service comes up as well.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,450
Not in as much detail though.

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,680
Well look at amazon event bridge which you can use for creating a venture of

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,130
an architecture so you can say that when a certain event happens in one service

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,150
then you need to do something else. So execute something.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,350
I also cover step functions which

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,200
is used for orchestrating various different processes

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,180
as part of a visual workflow. Quite an interesting service.

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,270
Another service that's important to understand and I have to

22
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,430
go into quite a bit of detail on this one

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,570
is the amazon Api gateway. So api gateway is used for creating

24
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,030
different types of API like HTTP APIs

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,480
and REST APIs

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,100
And it does require quite a bit of understanding for the exams,

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,850
so we'll go into lots of detail there.

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,660
Now all of this is going to be put into practice, we will be creating APIs

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,120
And microservices and using application integration services

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,010
to connect different application components together.

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,150
So lots of really interesting hands on lessons. Hope you enjoy them.
