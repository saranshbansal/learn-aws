00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,940
In this lesson, I'm going to cover the Simple Notification Service in a bit more detail.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,810
So SNS is all about sending notifications.

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:20,770
It's a publisher/subscriber system. So, we have a publisher and that publisher will produce some kind

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,160
of information that it sends to an SNS topic.

5
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,760
SNS will then forward via different transport protocols to the subscribers.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,180
So, a transport protocol is something like HTTP or an email or an SMS text message.

7
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,660
There's a few different options to use. And then the subscriber is the actual service or endpoint where

8
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,280
the information is received.

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:51,760
So, for example, if 100 users subscribe to a topic via email, all of those 100 users will receive

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,270
any message that gets published to the SNS topic.

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,350
Now, as subscribers, you can also have things like Lambda functions, SQS queues, or web applications.

12
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:09,550
Amazon SNS is highly available, durable, secure, and a fully managed publisher/subscriber messaging

13
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,090
service.

14
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,940
It provides what we call a topic for high throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging.

15
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,190
Now, the push-based is really important to understand as it's opposed to SQS.

16
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:29,770
So, whenever you see SQS or SNS side by side, remember, with SQS, it's a pull-based mechanism where the

17
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,170
consumer pulls the message from the queue.

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,340
It polls the queue,

19
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:39,700
if there's a message there, it will process that message. Whereas with SNS, it's push-based. The notification

20
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,810
goes to the topic and then it's immediately forwarded to all of the subscribers.

21
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,910
With SNS, you can fan out messages to a large number of subscriber endpoints.

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:59,230
And those include SQS queues, Lambda functions, HTTP or HTTPS webhooks, mobile push, and SMS. And also,

23
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,250
of course, email.

24
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:06,340
Multiple recipients get grouped using a topic, so the topic is the key component you need to understand,

25
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,850
and it's an access point for allowing those recipients to subscribe to receive notifications.

26
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,350
One topic can support deliveries to multiple endpoint types as well.

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,410
SNS uses simple APIs, and there's really easy integration with many applications. And we've seen

28
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,090
that so far in the course. And we'll keep on using SNS for a few more of the hands-on lessons as

29
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,360
well.

30
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,470
You get flexible delivery over multiple transport protocols.

31
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,320
There's an architectural pattern that comes up in exam questions quite a lot. And that is where we have

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,520
Amazon SNS with SQS

33
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,390
fan out. What this means is that you subscribe one or more SQS queues to

34
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,760
an SNS topic. SQS manages the subscription and any necessary permissions.

35
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,480
And when you publish a message to the topic, SNS will send that message to every subscribed queue.

36
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,350
So, it looks something like this.

37
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:07,090
We have an SNS topic and we have multiple subscribed queues. And we're fanning out the notifications

38
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,100
that come in to those different queues.
