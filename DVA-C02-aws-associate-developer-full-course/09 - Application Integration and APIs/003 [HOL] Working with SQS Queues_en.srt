1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,210
In this hands-on lesson, we're going to work with Amazon SQS queues.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,590
We're going to create a standard queue and a FIFO queue

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,110
and we're going to have a look at the various

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,270
options and how the different types of queues actually work.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,660
So I'm in the Amazon Simple Queue Service console here.

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,930
And we have actually used this earlier in the course.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,280
We did create a couple of queues for previous hands-on lessons.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,670
But this time we'll go into lots more detail.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,360
So let's create a queue.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,360
Now, the first queue I'm going to create is a standard queue.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,610
So you see I can choose here between standard and FIFO.

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,038
I'll just call this one My STD queue

13
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:42,460
so I can recognize it as being my standard queue.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,890
Now you'll note some of the various configuration options here.

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,638
So we've been through these in the theory lessons.

16
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:52,250
We have the visibility timeout, we have the delivery day,

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,300
we have the received message wait time,

18
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,930
the message retention period, and the max message size.

19
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,270
So the visibility timeout as you know, is the period of time

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,060
in which once you've actually received the message,

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,520
you have that time to process it and it will be invisible in the queue.

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,290
After that expires, it becomes visible again

23
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,460
and can be processed by another consumer.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,890
So that can be between zero and 12 hours.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,100
The delivery day gives your consumers a bit more

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,990
time before new messages will appear in the queue.

27
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,330
So they don't actually appear in the queue immediately.

28
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,440
And you can specify a time period between zero seconds and 15 minutes.

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,800
The received message wait time is the period of time that

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,160
polling will actually wait for messages to appear in the queue.

31
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,980
And we're gonna look at how we can work with different

32
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,050
times on that a bit later on in this lesson.

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,280
Then we have the message retention period. So how long do they stay in the queue?

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,850
That's one minute up to 14 days.

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,190
And the max message size is between one kilobyte and 256 kilobytes.

36
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:56,960
All stuff that does get tested on in the exam.

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,820
Now we have a resource-based access policy.

38
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,985
I'm not going to change anything here but you can see the default settings.

39
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:06,590
So we have the basic option defined.

40
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,990
It says who can send messages? Well, only the queue owner.

41
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,190
Who can receive messages? Only the queue owner.

42
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,060
And you can see in here we then have the effect allow, we have the AWS account number

43
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,970
and then we have SQS* so all API actions associated with SQS.

44
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,650
And then we have the actual ARN of this specific queue.

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,810
We'll cover redrive policy a bit later on.

46
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,060
So that's where we can specify a dead letter queue.

47
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,070
For encryption, SQS does provide encryption in transit by default.

48
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,150
But then you can add at REST encryption here.

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,650
So I'll leave that disabled for now.

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,210
Dead letter queues will come too soon and tags are just tags.

51
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,690
So let's create this queue.

52
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,850
Great so now I have one queue.

53
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,550
Let's go back. We're now going to create another queue.

54
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,715
And this one will be a FIFO queue.

55
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,760
So it's going to support first in first out delivery.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,510
I'm going to call this My-FIFO-Queue.FIFO.

57
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,260
So note that it has the .fifo extension to it.

58
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,825
Now much of this is the same.

59
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,690
But as you can see there are some different options here.

60
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,560
We have this content-based deduplication.

61
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,400
When this is enabled, the deduplication ID is optional.

62
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,860
We'll leave that off.

63
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,560
You can enable high throughput FIFO

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,860
or you can leave that disabled.

65
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,400
There's then a scope for deduplication and that's either

66
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:37,515
at the queue level or at the message group level.

67
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,160
We'll change it to message group to experiment.

68
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,770
We then have a throughput limit that's per queue or per message group ID.

69
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,860
I'll leave that as the default setting.

70
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,820
And that's it. I'm not going to change anything else. Let's just create this queue.

71
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,690
So now we have our two queues.

72
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,490
Let's go into the first queue.

73
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,560
And what we're gonna do is send a message.

74
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,360
So we click on send and receive messages here.

75
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,150
We can just type something in

76
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,960
and send this message.

77
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,990
So now what we can do is poll for messages

78
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,060
and we'll see that the message appears.

79
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,860
And when we actually poll for messages, the receive count goes up to one.

80
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,630
So it has actually been received.

81
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,310
We're essentially initiating a received message API action.

82
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,350
Now if we head over to the FIFO queue,

83
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,060
so let's choose My FIFO queue.

84
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,840
And we're gonna do the same. We're gonna send and receive messages.

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,770
And now I'm going to type in test message again.

86
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,260
I'm going to give it a group ID. Let's call that group one.

87
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,220
And let's give it a deduplication ID and that's just gonna be 123456.

88
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,150
And let's send that message.

89
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,760
So now let's send another message.

90
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,450
It's also going to be in group one

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,770
and it's also going to have the same deduplication ID.

92
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,150
So let's send that message.

93
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,140
And then let's poll for messages in the queue.

94
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,370
Now as you can see, there's only one message.

95
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,860
And that's because we did turn on that deduplication at the group level.

96
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,450
So if I change the group here to group two, send message.

97
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,260
Now I have another message in the queue.

98
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,030
And of course if I change this number, so I just add something onto it and send,

99
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,160
and now I should get an additional message.

100
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,460
Sometimes you have to stop and start and now we have additional messages.

101
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,090
So we have those three messages. So that's the difference.

102
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,450
So with the message group ID, we can deduplicate the

103
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,438
messages that are sent. So if two messages have the same deduplication ID

104
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:41,350
and they're in the same group, if you're using group-based deduplication,

105
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,650
then they will be duplicated. So the extra message will be removed.

106
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:49,011
If you do it at the queue level, then it's going to focus at the queue level

107
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:50,580
rather than the group level.

108
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,810
And of course it's up to you to create your application

109
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,850
to actually add in the deduplication IDs to support your use case.

110
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,040
I'm going to create another queue.

111
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,460
And this is going to be a dead letter queue.

112
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,060
It's going to be a standard queue called My DL queue.

113
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,040
Under redrive policy we can identify which source queues can use this queue.

114
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,490
As a dead letter queue.

115
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,190
So let's click on enabled. I can sort by queue.

116
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,730
So I can filter and only allow messages to be moved into this queue

117
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,785
from my standard queue.

118
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,778
So that's fine. I'm going to do that.

119
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,461
Click on create queue.

120
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,960
Let's go to my standard queue.

121
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,760
Choose dead letter queue,

122
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,890
edit,

123
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,460
and then we scroll down to where it says dead letter queue,

124
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,560
select enabled.

125
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,240
And then we're going to find our dead letter queue. There it is My DL queue.

126
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,260
And for maximum retries I'm going to put three.

127
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,110
And that means we'll only be able to retry

128
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,160
processing of a message a maximum of three times.

129
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,760
So let's save that.

130
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,660
And what we're going to do now

131
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,140
is click on send and receive messages.

132
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,560
We're just going to try and send a test message.

133
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,760
Let's send a message.

134
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,150
And now we're going to poll for messages and our receive

135
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,360
count will go to one for this message.

136
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,360
Let's stop polling. Poll again.

137
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,130
Receive count goes up.

138
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,450
Let's do it a third time.

139
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,160
So now we have three receives.

140
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,260
One of the messages that was already in our queue seems to have disappeared.

141
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,650
And let's just do it one more time.

142
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,960
And now we should find that both messages disappear from the queue

143
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,560
because we exceed that redrive.

144
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,450
So if we now go back up to queues,

145
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,560
choose My DL queue.

146
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,250
And let's click on send and receive messages, poll.

147
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,190
And now you can see that we have these two messages.

148
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,530
So because we exceeded that value of three for the maximum number of retries

149
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,640
the messages that weren't processed were then pushed into the dead letter queue.

150
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,550
So now we can do something else with them to check what went wrong.

151
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,460
We're now going to run a few commands so we can work with the CLI.

152
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,400
So in your code directory from the course download,

153
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,120
you've got Amazon SQS and then AWS SQS CLI commands.

154
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,600
Now the first one is simply AWS SQS list queues.

155
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,310
And that will help us get our queue URL. So if I paste that in,

156
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,970
it will return the URLs of our different queues.

157
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,800
Now I want to choose this one here so I can copy that to my clipboard.

158
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,100
Now, I've already entered that in here. But if you might need to come in

159
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,680
and paste in your queue URL.

160
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,250
Now, I'm not going to use all of this. I'm going to leave off this delay seconds.

161
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,260
So what I'm gonna do is copy this to my clipboard.

162
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,471
And back on the command line I'm going to paste that in.

163
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:40,659
Now before we get started,

164
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,200
let's go to SQS and we're gonna start polling for messages.

165
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,660
So back in SQS, I'm going to go back up to queues, choose my standard queue.

166
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,250
I'm going to click on send and receive messages and then poll.

167
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,040
And of course there's nothing there yet. So now I'm going to run this command,

168
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,550
come back, and straight away I see that message.

169
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,320
So that's coming through instantly.

170
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,830
And that's because we didn't add a delay seconds.

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,720
For the next command, we're simply going to put in --delay-seconds.

172
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,940
And we're going to give it a parameter. So that's going to be 10 in this case.

173
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,700
Now just make sure that you're still polling. In this case I'm going to stop polling.

174
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,160
Poll again.

175
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,630
We've still got our message from before.

176
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,580
Come back.

177
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,150
Let's hit enter.

178
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,750
Come back in the queue.

179
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,260
What we should find is within a few seconds we have a new message come through.

180
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,560
And there it is. There's our new message.

181
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,150
So that's what the delay seconds does.

182
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,540
For the next test, what we're going to do

183
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,460
is we're going to test using the wait time seconds.

184
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,020
So this is the difference between long polling and short polling.

185
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,990
Now, I need to remove these messages now before our next test.

186
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,620
So let's delete these messages.

187
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,500
So now we have an empty queue.

188
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,900
And what we're going to do is practice with the wait time seconds.

189
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,660
So this controls the behavior of polling. So short polling or long polling.

190
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,660
Now with a zero here, that's going to be short polling.

191
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,360
So let's copy this to our clipboards. Now we know there's nothing in the queue.

192
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,580
So let's go over and paste this into our command line.

193
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,160
And we have to command lines side by side here. You'll see why in a moment.

194
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,710
But first I'm going to try using wait time seconds zero.

195
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,080
And what happens is the API action checks if there's a message.

196
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,020
There weren't any messages in the queue so it just immediately stops.

197
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,388
Okay, so that's cost us now a couple of API actions,

198
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:33,390
so there are charges associated with that.

199
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,920
So what we want to do instead is use long polling.

200
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,750
So with long polling, what I'm going to do

201
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,560
is I'm going to change this. So let's change this one to 10 seconds.

202
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,160
And I'm going to copy that,

203
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,260
paste that in.

204
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,180
I'm not going to run it just yet. And then we're going to copy this command here.

205
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,760
So we have a receive message and we have a send message.

206
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,660
So let's copy the send message.

207
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,970
And the send is going to go from the right window.

208
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,660
So what we can do here

209
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,270
is I'm going to run this and it should wait for up to 10 seconds.

210
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,660
So you can see it's waiting now, nothing's happening.

211
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,550
Now, if I run this command, straight away we see a response.

212
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,980
So what's happened is I've used the send message API to send

213
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,350
a message into the queue from this right hand window

214
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,660
and in the left window here we already had long polling enabled

215
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,070
and we were waiting for messages to appear in the queue.

216
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,850
So that's how long polling works.

217
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,190
So back in my queues here, we finished for this particular lesson.

218
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,420
Now I'm going to keep the My Standard queue.

219
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,091
We're gonna use that in another lesson.

220
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:41,670
But we can actually delete the other two queues.

221
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,950
So I'm going to delete my FIFO queue and my DL queue.

222
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,140
And those are gone.

223
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,760
And that's it for this lesson. I'll see you in the next one.
