1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,985
In this hands-on lesson, we're going to create some tables in DynamoDB,

2
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,200
add some items and look at some configuration settings.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,320
So I'm logged into DynamoDB.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,250
And what I'm going to do first here is create a new table.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,451
So the first thing we need to do is give it a name.

6
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:26,060
I'm simply going to call mine My Forum.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,490
Then we must enter a partition key. So this is mandatory we need a partition key.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,490
I'm going to call mine Post ID.

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,170
So the idea here is that I'm creating a forum and in that forum the

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,950
partition key will be the ID of the post which should be a unique value.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,400
Now optionally you can create a sort key but for

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,760
this particular table we're not going to do that.

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,500
Now if I scroll down a little way you can see

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,180
that we have the default settings applied.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,850
If we want to customize settings we can choose customize,

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,300
we can choose the table class.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,260
So we have the standard class or the infrequently-accessed class.

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:13,050
So IA would be recommended for tables that store data that's infrequently accessed.

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,763
And that might save you some money.

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,460
Then we have the read and write capacity settings.

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,220
The capacity calculator is a really useful tool for calculating the read

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,850
capacity units and write capacity units you need for your table.

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,820
So that will provide the amount of performance that you need.

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,310
And it also is linked then to billing.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,230
So in here you can enter the average item size that you're expecting,

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,660
how many reads a second, how many writes a second,

27
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,110
and then which model you want to use for consistency.

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,090
Now we'll be covering the RCUs and WCUs.

29
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,550
and the various different consistency models a bit later on in this section.

30
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,610
So next we actually have the read write capacity settings.

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,280
So the calculator helps you work out what you need

32
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,360
and then you can specify them either using on-demand or provisioned.

33
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,276
With on-demand, you're paying for the actual reads and writes

34
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:12,194
that your application performs,

35
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:15,990
whereas provisioned you're actually provisioning a certain allocation

36
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,070
and then if you don't use it you still end up paying for it.

37
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,780
So you've got to understand what's best for your model.

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,860
Then we can specify individually the read capacity and write capacity that we need.

39
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,960
Secondary indexes are something we're going to cover a bit later in this section.

40
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,710
And here we can see an estimated cost.

41
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,188
And this should fall well within the free tier.

42
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:42,360
For encryption at rest there's a couple of options for the key that's used.

43
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,940
Now the data is always encrypted but you get to

44
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,890
choose whether it's the key that's owned by DynamoDB, whether it's an AWS-managed key

45
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,210
or it's one that you're storing in your account.

46
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,320
So you're using the key management service.

47
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,690
So I'm not changing any of those settings. I'm just going to create my table.

48
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,460
The table has been created. That just took a few seconds.

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,760
Now on the left hand side here we have tables so we can then choose our table

50
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,860
and then we go into update settings where we can change the settings

51
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,370
of our table or explore items where we can actually see the items.

52
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,160
We don't have any items at this point.

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,550
So under update settings, you'll see that there's various different options here.

54
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,430
We will be exploring most of these throughout this section.

55
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,610
What I'm going to do now is create a couple of items. So let's go to explore items.

56
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,860
I'm going to create an item, so I'm manually going to add an item into my table.

57
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,300
So in this example I'm adding a post to my forum.

58
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,160
And it has a specific value. So that's the unique value for this post.

59
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,860
Now I might also want to add additional attributes, so let's add a string.

60
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,950
And this is going to be the subject

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,350
and I'm simply going to type Hello.

62
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,420
Then I'm going to add another attribute.

63
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,410
This time it's going to be a number.

64
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,391
So you see there's various different

65
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:08,370
options for the type of attribute that we create.

66
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,820
And this one will be replies, and we'll give it a number, let's make that 12.

67
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,610
So I'm gonna create my item.

68
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,750
So my item has been created.

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,950
And we can now see it in the table.

70
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,260
Now I want to create another item.

71
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,370
And what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

72
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,200
attempt to create another item with the same information.

73
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,450
So let's just enter all of the same values as before

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,960
add the number.

75
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,150
This one is going to be replies 12.

76
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,360
And let's try and create this item.

77
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,690
And we have a error message. And that is the conditional request failed.

78
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,480
An item with the primary key you provided already exists.

79
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,520
So of course we could change the number of replies.

80
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,960
It doesn't matter.

81
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,080
We can change the subject line.

82
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,650
That also doesn't matter.

83
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,350
The only thing that matters is the post ID.

84
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,940
Because we don't have a sort key, so we're not using what's called a composite key.

85
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,260
We must have a unique value for this item here.

86
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,960
So what I'm going to do is just change that value and create the item.

87
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,680
And this time it will work successfully.

88
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,450
Now let's go back up to tables.

89
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,360
And we're going to create a second table.

90
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,470
This one is going to be called my store

91
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,560
as if we're creating a store for an eCommerce backend.

92
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,940
Now I'm going to add in a partition key.

93
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,660
This time it's going to be client ID.

94
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,460
It's also going to be a string.

95
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,810
And then we're also going to add a sort key. So now we're creating a composite key.

96
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,960
So a partition key with a sort key.

97
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,960
And the sort key is going to be created.

98
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,320
And I'm going to leave that as a string.

99
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,080
And there's various different ways you can record dates and times.

100
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,760
So other than that, I'm not changing anything. So let's just create this table.

101
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,760
So my store has now been created. Let's click on my store, go to explore items.

102
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,060
We're going to create an item.

103
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,890
Now you'll see that we must enter both the client ID and the created.

104
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,530
So both of these boxes are here already for us.

105
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,600
I'm going to enter an email address for the client ID.

106
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,350
And then I'm going to enter a timestamp for created.

107
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,460
And then we could add something else. So this is supposed to be an eCommerce store.

108
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,550
So let's say that we're adding a category

109
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,210
for our products.

110
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,960
And this one might be a phone.

111
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,860
And let's just create that item.

112
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,951
So now we have that item in our table. We can see the client ID,

113
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:48,650
the created timestamp, and the category.

114
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,760
What I want to do now is create an additional item.

115
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,170
And it's also going to be another order from the same user, so the same client ID.

116
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,950
Now remember that with my forum,

117
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,560
we weren't able to do that because there was only a partition key, no sort key.

118
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,360
And the post ID in this case had to be unique. We couldn't have two of the same.

119
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,760
But that wouldn't be good in a store because we want the

120
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,010
same person to come back and buy multiple items from our store.

121
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,860
So there's going to be an additional entry from Chris.

122
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,960
But as long as there's a different timestamp which there always should be,

123
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,260
then the two together become unique. So that's the composite key.

124
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,180
So let's create an item.

125
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,850
And I'm going to put chris@example.com again.

126
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,260
I'm going to paste in a timestamp which is a different timestamp to before.

127
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,100
And then we can add in some kind of attributes.

128
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,650
So maybe this time I'll add category computer.

129
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,360
And let's create that item.

130
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,560
So this time it worked.

131
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,430
And that's because we have a composite key.

132
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,750
So the combination of the client ID and the created timestamp, the sort key here

133
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,250
are unique.

134
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,340
So that works really well for this eCommerce store.

135
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,010
And that's it for this lesson.

136
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,760
Now we've finished with my forum but we're going to keep my store.

137
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,860
So I'm going to go back to update settings, choose my forum, go to actions,

138
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,710
and delete table.

139
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,280
And then I just need to type delete

140
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,200
and that table will be deleted for us.
