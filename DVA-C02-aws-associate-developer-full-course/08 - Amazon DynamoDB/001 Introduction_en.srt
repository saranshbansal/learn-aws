1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,660
this section is all about amazon DynamoDB.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,880
So an entire section about one database service and that's because

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,560
the developer associate has a lot of coverage of amazon DynamoDB.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:20,120
So DynamoDB is a no SQL server list database that runs on AWS. It's an AWS service.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,950
It's one of the services that they've created themselves. So it's their technology

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,150
with DynamoDB. We create tables and then we can populate those tables with our data.

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,640
It's extremely flexible, it's extremely high performance and low latency.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,710
So for the exam you will need to understand quite a lot about DynamoDB.

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,530
So we're going to be building through the knowledge as we go

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,260
through the section with lots of hands on exercises as always.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,080
Now you'll definitely need to understand the pricing and how you allocate R C U.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,710
S and W. C. U. S. You'll know what they are a bit later on in this section.

13
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,950
Make sure you do follow those exercises closely because there's quite

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,650
a few questions coming up in exams where you need to calculate

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,850
RCUs and WCUs for a specific requirement.

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,560
So you need to know how to do that math in the exam without any calculators.

17
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,190
And there are many other features of DynamoDB that get covered in exam questions.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,990
Hence the large amount of coverage in this section.

19
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,180
So it is quite a long section with lots of hands on and lots of theory.

20
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,350
I hope you enjoy it and I'll see you in the next lesson
