Hi, guys. In this lesson I'm going to cover EC2 user data and metadata.

2
00:00:10,823 --> 00:00:14,025
These are both really important features of EC2.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,706
So firstly, let's have a look at what user data is.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,736
So let's say we go into the management console and we're going to launch an instance.

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:31,540
Now, when we do so on the configuration page, we're able to enter some code and this can be our code.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,637
Now, don't worry, you don't need to understand this particular code here,

7
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:39,168
but this particular code is actually installing a Web service.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,800
Now, the point is that you're able to run this code and it runs the first time the instance starts up.

9
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:52,611
So you can configure certain things to happen through these commands on your instance

10
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,883
when it first boots.

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,390
So in this case, it's actually going to install a Web service on our EC2 instance.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,490
Now, EC2 user data is limited to 16 kilobytes.

13
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,340
So there's a certain amount of code that you're able to run.

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:13,550
If you're using a Windows instance, then you can run Batch scripts and PowerShell scripts as well.

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,329
And what we're doing here is, as you can see, we're entering the text.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,350
You can also upload a file as well.

17
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,580
So that's user data.

18
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,316
Now, what is metadata?

19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:31,681
Metadata is some information about your EC2 instance, and it's available at this particular address.

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,414
So this address, you can run this from a command window on your computer and it's a local address.

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,363
This IP address here corresponds to your local computer.

22
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,771
It doesn't actually connect over a network.

23
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:50,650
It's just finding this information on the computer that you're actually running this on, on your EC2

24
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,393
instance.

25
00:01:51,790 --> 00:02:03,688
So the path is HTTP://169.254 and then it repeats 169.254/latest/meta-data.

26
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,211
Now, don't worry, you won't have to remember that for the exam, but it's a very useful path to know.

27
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,551
So what do you find when you actually put in this URL?

28
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,078
Well, this is some of the information you can return.

29
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:22,270
Here we're using a command called curl, which just checks this URL.

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,870
And if we just put in this path here, we get a list of information.

31
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:31,084
And this is data about our instance.

32
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:37,095
So we can query any of these different pieces of data and we'll find some information.

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,662
So let's have a look at some examples of what you might find.

34
00:02:41,385 --> 00:02:48,761
Well, in this case, we're putting in the path we saw before and then we're adding local-IPv4 on the end.

35
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:55,268
And that actually returns the IPv4 private IP address of this instance.

36
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:58,544
And you can see it here just before the command prompt.

37
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:04,432
If we run another command here, you can see this time we're asking for the public IPv4 address

38
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:07,234
and it's showing us the public address.

39
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,674
So remember the difference between user data and metadata.

40
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:19,753
User data gives you the ability to run commands when the system is starting and metadata can return

41
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:22,930
information about the instance that's recorded locally.

42
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,890
And that's really about as much as you need to know for the exam.
