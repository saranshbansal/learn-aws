Hello and welcome to this section.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,650
In this section I'm going to cover the amazon virtual private cloud (VPC).

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,310
elastic load balancing and amazon EC2.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,820
Now you are expected to understand these as kind

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,460
of prerequisite knowledge for the developer associate exam.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,560
In this course I go over it at a basic level

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,650
but I do move through quite quickly.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,010
If you want more background on these services then I go

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,810
into much more detail in the solutions architect associate course.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,420
But for what you need to know for the developer associate exam,

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,560
this should be enough.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,110
So in this section you're going to learn how to create your own custom VPC.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,410
You're going to launch EC2 instances and elastic load balancers and see

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,560
how you can scale your application and load balance it for high availability

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,400
and there are plenty of hands on exercises to make

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,350
sure you get your hands dirty and enjoy the practice.
