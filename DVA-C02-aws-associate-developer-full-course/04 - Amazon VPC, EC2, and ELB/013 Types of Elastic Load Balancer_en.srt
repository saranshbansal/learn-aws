00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:11,020
In this lesson, I'm going to cover the different types of Elastic Load Balancer available on AWS

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,120
and you do need to understand for the exam which one to use for specific use cases.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,350
The first type is the Application Load Balancer, of the ALB.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,150
The ALB will listen at the request level, so it's listening at layer seven.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:34,690
That means the actual listener is using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, and the ALB can route connections

6
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,540
based on information at that level.

7
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,220
So, for example, it supports path-based routing.

8
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,900
That means the path in the URL can be used to determine where to send the connection.

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,070
So which group of instances on the backend to send the connection to.

10
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,800
It also supports host-based routing.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,940
That means it's checking the domain name and making a routing decision there.

12
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:04,959
Query string parameter-based routing checks the query strings in the URL and will then route-based on

13
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,770
that information.

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,200
So the ALB is quite intelligent in how it can check this information and make routing decisions.

15
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:18,850
The ALB supports instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions and containers as targets.

16
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:26,290
Next, we have the Network Load Balancer, the NLB. This operates at the connection level, so it's

17
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,760
more around layer four.

18
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,080
It's using IP protocol data to make routing decisions.

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:39,370
The NLB will listen on TCP, TLS, UDP and TCP_UDP.

20
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,440
Both the ALB and the NLB are the newer generation of load balancers.

21
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:51,250
Now that an NLB is really good for when you need ultra-high performance and extremely low latency, or

22
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,620
if you need TLS offloading at scale.

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,560
So that means it's processing the encryption for TLS connections and offloading that from your back

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,580
end instances.

25
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:07,600
So, if you see exam questions asking for a very low latency load balancer, it's likely to be the NLB.

26
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,520
And then the other key piece of information is going to help you determine which type of load balancer

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:12,970
to use

28
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,130
out of these two is the protocol.

29
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,940
So if you're looking for UDP or TCP or TLS, then that's going to be a Network Load Balancer. If you

30
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,680
need to route based on information at the http or https level,

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,200
that's going to be the ALB. Next

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,890
we have the Classic Load Balancer, the CLB. Now

33
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,380
you really shouldn't see this on the exam anymore.

34
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,420
There could very occasionally be a reference to it, but it's very unlikely to be the correct answer.

35
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,020
AWS don't really want you to be using this anymore.

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,480
They'd prefer you to use an ALB or an NLB for the same sort of use cases

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,880
you might have used a CLB for in the old days before the newer generations came along.

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,660
The CLB performs routing at layer four and layer seven, but it doesn't have anywhere near the intelligence

39
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,490
of the ALB or the NLB.

40
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,180
Lastly, we have the Gateway Load Balancer, the GLB.

41
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:13,300
This is very new and it has just started appearing on the exam recently, so you may see some questions.

42
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:20,680
The GLB is used in front of virtual appliances such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, intrusion

43
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,130
prevention systems, and deep packet inspection systems.

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,720
It operates on layer three and it listens for all packets on all ports.

45
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:36,310
It then forwards the incoming traffic to the target group specified in listener rules. And it exchanges

46
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,290
traffic with appliances using the GENEVE Protocol on port 6081.

47
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,130
Now I just want to cover the ALB and the NLB side by side.

48
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,350
For most load balancing use cases, these are going to be the ones that you're going to use, so you

49
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,640
really need to know how to determine which one you should be using for your use case.

50
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,970
So remember, with the OSI layer, the ALB is at layer seven and the NLB is at layer four.

51
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:07,300
That means these two load balancers are using different information to make their decisions on where

52
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,410
to forward connections.

53
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:15,490
The targets type for an ALB can be an IP address, an instance, a Lambda function or a container.

54
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,519
With the NLB it can be an IP address or an EC2 instance. For protocol listeners

55
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:31,660
The ALB supports http and https. And GLB is supported through http too. The NLB listens on TCP, UDP

56
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,160
and TLS. For private link, which we'll cover later in the VPC section

57
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,170
there's no support for the ALB but there is for the NLB. For static IP addresses

58
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,090
the ALB does not have them, whereas the NLB does support static IP addresses.

59
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,760
That means the actual nodes of your load balancer that run in your subnets can have static addresses.

60
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,790
That's good for whitelisting and firewalls and we'll cover that more

61
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:02,020
later on. You get http header-based routing with the ALB but you do not with the NLB. For source IP

62
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,450
preservation, the ALB uses x-forwarded-for.

63
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,650
That means the information about the IP address of the client is forwarded in the x-forwarded-for

64
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:17,130
header, whereas it's native in the protocol data with the NLB. For SSL termination

65
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,010
you have load balancer terminate with the ALB. And load balancer or a target with the NLB.

66
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,120
Let's finish off going over a few use cases. For the ALB

67
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,240
you'd use this when you have web applications and a layer seven routing, microservices architectures such

68
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:41,970
as Docker Containers and lambda targets. For the NLB, TCP and UDP based applications where you need

69
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,840
ultra-low latency and you might need static IP addresses.

70
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,080
It's also used with VPC endpoint services.

71
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,840
And then lastly, for the Gateway Load Balancer, you'd use this for load balancing virtual appliances

72
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:02,040
such as intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, next generation firewalls, web

73
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,300
application firewalls, and distributed denial of service protection systems.

74
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:12,870
It also integrates with Auto Scaling groups for elasticity, and you can apply network monitoring and

75
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,130
logging for analytics.
