00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,300
Hi guys, in this lesson we're going to use the Command Line Interface to create

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,950
an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,411
Now it does rely on the fact that you performed the

4
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:20,960
lessons using the management console earlier on because we're going to use the same

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,560
launch template and target group that we created earlier.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,000
In the course download,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,060
you'll find the EC2 directory and you'll find this file, create-asg-alb-cli.md.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,040
Now, in here you're going to find the commands that we need to run.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,490
So what we need to do is make sure that the information in here is correct

10
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:43,360
before we run these commands.

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,160
So the first one is to create the Auto Scaling group.

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,020
So we use the command AWS Auto Scaling group, create Auto Scaling group.

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,750
We give it a name. I'm going to call mine ASG2.

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,920
We give it a launch template.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,890
I already called my launch template My EC2 Web App.

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,985
So I'm going to use the same name here.

17
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:09,060
I want the minimum size to be one, max to be three,

18
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,460
and the desired capacity to be two.

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,470
And I want to use two availability zones, us-east-1A and us-east-1B.

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,080
Now for those availability zones we need to specify the zone identifiers.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,910
That's the subnet IDs.

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,910
So let's make sure those are correct.

23
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,460
In the VPC management console, I'm going to go to subnets,

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,750
choose public-1A,

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,660
and then copy the subnet ID.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,750
Come back,

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,570
paste that in, mine was already correct and then do the same for public-1B.

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,650
So just make sure you got the correct subnets IDs.

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,500
Mine's already done so there shouldn't be any change there.

30
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,860
That's all ready to go.

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,190
So now I can copy this whole command to my clipboard,

32
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,160
and on a command prompt, I'm going to run this command.

33
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,680
You know how to use profiles. We did that earlier on in this course.

34
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,560
And what I'm going to use is a profile which is called cloud labs.

35
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:12,360
And that profile has access keys associated with my user account.

36
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,560
So make sure you have your CLI set up with your user credentials,

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,960
not the ones we used for Paul earlier on.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,010
And if you need to either delete the credentials file and recreate it by

39
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,060
running AWS Configure or just create a profile for your specific user name.

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,320
So let's try and run enter and see if this works.

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,920
And we didn't get any response in terms of error messages so it looks like it worked.

42
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,360
Let's go to the EC2 management console,

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,160
go to Auto Scaling groups,

44
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,280
give it a refresh.

45
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,550
And there we go. We've got the ASG2.

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,260
And we can see the desired capacity of two.

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,120
So we should find that means that our instances are going to be launched.

48
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,060
Let's refresh EC2.

49
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,860
And we've got two pending instances here.

50
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:00,910
So that worked.

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,110
Next we need to create the load balancer, create a listener and then attach TG1,

52
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,923
the target group one to ASG2.

53
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:13,620
So the first one is the create load balancer command.

54
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,360
Note that this is AWS ELBV2 create load balancer.

55
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,450
We're going to call it ALB2.

56
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,530
Now, I've already added my subnet IDs.

57
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,460
So, you can copy yours down from the first command

58
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,250
and then --security groups.

59
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,350
And I've specified my security group ID.

60
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,538
For that, you can go back to the management console

61
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,890
and simply copy the security group ID

62
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,465
for the web access security group that you're using.

63
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:41,790
So that's all set up.

64
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,610
Let's copy this to my clipboard.

65
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,070
I'm going to paste that in.

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,150
Again, I'm going to use my profile, hit enter,

67
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,470
and that should create the load balancer.

68
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,010
And we can see some information about what's being created.

69
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,250
Back in the EC2 management console, we should now be able to go down to load balancers

70
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,160
and if we give this a refresh we should soon see our load balancer.

71
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,060
I need to remove this filter.

72
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,440
And there we go. We've got ALB2 and that's being created.

73
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,890
It's in a provisioning state.

74
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,478
The next command is to create the listener, so we need a listener

75
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,290
and we need to specify the ports that we're going to listen on the

76
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,560
protocol and also what we're going to do for forwarding.

77
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,650
So in this case, we create a listener using AWS ELBV2 create listener.

78
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,760
And then we have --load-balancer-ARN.

79
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,690
And this is the ARN of our load balancer.

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,990
So simply come back to the management console, copy the ARN

81
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,260
for your load balancer, come back here.

82
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,150
I need to update mine.

83
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,650
So let's paste this in.

84
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,750
Now I've got my ARN correctly set.

85
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,550
The protocol is HTTP the port is 80

86
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,860
and the default actions are to forward to a target group

87
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,850
And we need to get the ARN for our target group.

88
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,160
So let's find our target group.

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,150
Copy the ARN,

90
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,938
and then paste it in.

91
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:10,110
So let's go here to target group ARN equals, remove this,

92
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,890
paste it in, and we've got our command.

93
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,760
So let's create our listener.

94
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,960
I'll paste that onto my command line and again specify my profile

95
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:20,650
and hit enter.

96
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:21,756
So that's done.

97
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,960
So if we go back to the management console,

98
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,910
we should be able to see this configuration.

99
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,150
Let's look at our load balancer, click on listeners,

100
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,290
and that's the listener we just created.

101
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,560
That's forwarding to target group one.

102
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,245
Now the only thing to do now is we need to attach

103
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,460
the target group to the load balancer.

104
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,800
For that, we're using the AWS Auto Scaling attach low balancer target groups.

105
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,950
The Auto Scaling group name is ASG2.

106
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,740
And then the target group ARN

107
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,160
is the ARN of our target group, so I'm going to copy that from up here

108
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,910
and then just override that information.

109
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,060
So now I have the correct ARN for my target group.

110
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,260
Copy to the clipboard, paste it in, add my profile information,

111
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,260
and hit enter.

112
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,910
And I think that's worked.

113
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,960
So now if we go back to our Auto Scaling group,

114
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,150
choose ASG2, scroll down

115
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,030
and we can see that we have the target group one attached to the load balancer.

116
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,860
So let's go and grab the ARN

117
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,660
for our load balancer, in fact the DNS name.

118
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,360
Let's copy the DNS name, go to a new tab in my browser and hit enter.

119
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:33,640
And there we go.

120
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,850
Just as before we now have instances running.

121
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,380
So that's how we can do this all using the Command Line Interface.

122
00:06:41,856 --> 00:06:44,731
If you want to delete your load balancer, an auto scaling group

123
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:48,560
using the command line, you can do that using these commands here.

124
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,190
I do need my load balancer at ARN.

125
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,060
So let's take that from here.

126
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,630
Copy and then I'll paste it into this command.

127
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,160
And lastly we only need the ASG2 name.

128
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,970
So it just requires the name of the Auto Scaling group.

129
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,230
So first let's delete our load balancer.

130
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,465
And that's done.

131
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:11,260
And then I'm going to delete my Auto Scaling group as well.

132
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,495
And that's done.

133
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,250
So now if we come back to the EC2 management console, refresh,

134
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,350
load balancer has gone.

135
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,840
And if I go down to Auto Scaling groups, we can already see

136
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,360
that it's in a deleting state.

137
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,890
So that should remove the load balancer,

138
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,260
the Auto Scaling Group and the EC2 instances.
