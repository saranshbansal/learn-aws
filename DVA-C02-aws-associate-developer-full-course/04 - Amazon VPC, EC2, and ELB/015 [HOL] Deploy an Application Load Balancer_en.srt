1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,900
Welcome to another hands-on lesson.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,251
In this one we're going to launch an application load balancer

3
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,560
and attach it to our Auto Scaling group.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,510
In the EC2 management console we already have our Auto Scaling group ASG1.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,150
And it has a desired capacity of two and there are actually two running instances.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,030
Now if I click on instances and if I

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,230
select one of these instances and click on networking,

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,759
we can see the subnet is public-1B.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,380
Let's have a look at the other instance.

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,770
Go to networking.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,340
And it's in public-1A.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,430
Great, that's exactly what I wanted.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,160
Next, I'm going to create a target group for our load balancer.

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,360
So I'm going to select crate target group.

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,298
Now, the target type for this is going to be instances

16
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:52,680
because we already have our EC2 instances.

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,110
Alternatively, you can use IP addresses, you can direct traffic to Lambda functions

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,830
and even other ALBs.

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,490
Now I'm going to call this TG1.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,980
The protocol is going to be HTTP, the port is going to be 80.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,831
So this is where traffic is going to be directed to from the load balancer.

22
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:17,250
And of course we have a web application, a simple Apache website running on Port 80.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,360
I need to make sure my VPC is correct.

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,440
I'm using this VPC for the Auto Scaling group and the instances.

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,240
So I need to have the same one for my load balancer.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,160
I'm going to leave the protocol version.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,140
For health check, we've got either HTTP or HTTPS.

28
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:39,140
HTTP is fine. We don't have a certificate on the instance so we can't use HTTPS.

29
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,630
We can click next.

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,410
And you can see that there are instances. I could directly add the instances

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,610
to the target group but I don't want to do that.

32
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,360
So let's just click on create target group.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,191
So that is the target group created.

34
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:56,340
Next, we're going to create the load balancer.

35
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,120
So let's create a load balancer.

36
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,770
Now I'm going to choose an Application Load Balancer. Click on create.

37
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,620
I'm going to call it ALB 1.

38
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,040
It's going to be an internet-facing load balancer

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,945
so we can connect to it from the internet using IPv4.

40
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:14,450
I don't want to use dual stack which means you get IPv4 and six.

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,650
Again, I want to make sure that my VPC is correctly selected.

42
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,460
And I'm going to select us-east-1A and 1B.

43
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,220
And in those two I want to make sure that I've got my public subnets, so public-1A.

44
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,660
In this case it's chosen the wrong one. So public-1B.

45
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,220
For security groups, I don't want to use this one.

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,280
I want to select my web access security group which already has HTTP enabled.

47
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,850
For listeners and routing,

48
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,850
we're going to create a listener which listens on port 80, that's HTTP

49
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,430
and then it forwards traffic to target group one, and remember

50
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,560
target group one also then is listening on port 80.

51
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,150
So the traffic comes straight through to the web application running on that port.

52
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,820
Now we don't need a global accelerator,

53
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,740
let's just come down and select create load balancer.

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,160
So that's the load balancer being created.

55
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,570
And you can see it's in a provisioning status.

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,930
But we haven't actually connected the instances to the target group.

57
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,980
We've connected the target group to the load balancer

58
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,860
but the Auto Scaling group is currently detached.

59
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,510
So what I want to do there is go to Auto Scaling groups,

60
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,460
click on ASG1,

61
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,370
scroll down and under load balancing, click on edit,

62
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,950
choose Application, Network or Gateway Load Balancers,

63
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,050
and then choose my target group.

64
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,738
So by doing it this way what happens is any time a new instance is launched

65
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:50,070
into the Auto Scaling group, it will be picked up by the

66
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,350
load balancer and load balancing will include that instance.

67
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,580
So let's select update.

68
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,796
And that's done.

69
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,050
So now it's just a matter of waiting for a few minutes for it all to start working.

70
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,630
Now if I go across to target groups,

71
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,050
select TG1, we can see that we have our two instances

72
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,350
and the health status is initial.

73
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,980
And that means that target registration is in progress.

74
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,149
So those instances will be registered and they should turn to healthy very soon.

75
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,880
So it just took a couple of minutes and now the health status has changed to healthy.

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,460
So our instances are registered.

77
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,060
Now if your instances don't become healthy, if they become unhealthy then

78
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,610
there's something wrong in your configuration so if you do follow

79
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,290
all of my steps exactly, you will get the same result.

80
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,560
But if you don't then it must mean that you've missed something.

81
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,616
So one of the things to check is your security groups to make sure

82
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:49,340
 you have your security groups set up to allow port 80.

83
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,348
We use the same security group for the instances and the load balancer.

84
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:57,410
So make sure you're using a security group that allows inbound

85
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,450
traffic from any source to port 80.

86
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,470
The other thing you can do is actually go

87
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,090
and try and connect directly to your instance using its public iP address.

88
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,060
So if I copy the public IP

89
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,160
and try and connect, I should see direct access to the instance.

90
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:17,870
If that doesn't work then you've done something wrong.

91
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,900
You need to make sure that the user data run correctly,

92
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,850
your instance has public connectivity to the internet and is reachable,

93
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,885
and of course you have the security groups set up.

94
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:30,590
So ours looks good.

95
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,530
So let's go down to load balancers.

96
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,190
And what I'm going to do is I'll just copy the DNS name of the load balancer,

97
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,120
go to a new tab in my browser,

98
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,430
put that in, and we can see that we get a result.

99
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,350
Now if I just hit refresh, we should get load balanced between the instances

100
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,320
in the different availability zones.

101
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,610
So that's all working.

102
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,390
So that's it for this lesson.

103
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,160
Now, we have finished with the load balancer and the Auto Scaling group.

104
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,031
So what we're going to do is simply terminate the load balancer

105
00:06:02,055 --> 00:06:05,190
by clicking on delete, click on yes delete.

106
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,280
Now don't delete the target group.

107
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,200
We are going to use that again. So you can leave the target group.

108
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,660
There's no cost to having a target group.

109
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,590
The other thing we're going to do is to terminate the Auto Scaling group.

110
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,150
So we can select our auto scaling group, click on delete.

111
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,110
We need to type delete to confirm and then delete.

112
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,660
And that will delete the Auto Scaling group and the EC2 instances.

113
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,300
So that's it for this lesson. I'll see you in the next one.
