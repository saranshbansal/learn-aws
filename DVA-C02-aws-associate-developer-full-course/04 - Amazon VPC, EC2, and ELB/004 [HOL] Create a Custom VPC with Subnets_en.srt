1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,659
Hey guys.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,550
In this lesson, we're going to create a custom Amazon virtual private cloud.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,619
This is essentially what we're going to create a virtual private

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,068
cloud with a CIDR block of 10 000 slash 16.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,200
There's going to be two public subnets and

6
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:21,819
two private subnets across two availability zones.

7
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:24,950
And you can see the CIDR blocks for each individual subnet

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,219
in the diagram.

9
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:26,600
Of course,

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,469
we're going to need an internet gateway so we can launch

11
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:32,819
instances and enable them to be accessible from the internet.

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:32,959
And,

13
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:34,770
and there's going to be a main route table.

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,041
That's the default route table that's created when we create our VPC.

15
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,000
We'll also create a separate route table. That's one for the private subnets.

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,701
That means it doesn't have the internet gateway.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,471
And if we want to in the future, of course,

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,910
we can put a path to a net gateway

19
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:55,390
if we want to enable outbound internet connectivity.

20
00:00:55,401 --> 00:01:00,741
So that's why we need a separate route table for the private subnets. So I'm in the

21
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:05,582
managmeent console, let's go across to VPC and we're going to create our VPC here.

22
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:07,652
So let's go to your VPC's,

23
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:11,622
we're going to click on create VPC. Now, there's a couple of options here.

24
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:16,152
We can do it manually or you can actually use this VPC and more function.

25
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:19,561
And that's really good. It gives you this diagrammatic output as well.

26
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:22,561
So it kind of shows you what you're creating, you can give it a name,

27
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:25,762
it's chosen the exact CIDR block we want by default.

28
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:28,821
And also you can then choose the number of availability zones

29
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,672
by default.

30
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:32,313
It's two with the number of public subnets as

31
00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:34,852
two and the number of private subnets as two.

32
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:39,453
Then you can choose whether you want to create NAT gateways and an S3 gateway as well.

33
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:40,413
So that's one option.

34
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:43,902
The other way is to just create VPC only and

35
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:47,252
then you can actually add in the subnets yourself.

36
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:49,032
So of course, both ways are really good.

37
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,542
I really enjoy this VPC and more, I think this is a great function

38
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:56,752
and you'll probably use that quite a lot. But let's look at the other way as well. And

39
00:01:56,853 --> 00:02:01,234
we're going to use a file which has defined the ranges that we're going to use.

40
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:04,984
So this is the file in the Amazon VPC directory in here

41
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,024
We've got the name,

42
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:09,684
the CIDR block and then we've got the information for the different subnets.

43
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:13,824
Public one, A public one B, private one A and private one B.

44
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,384
So let's start by copying the name of the VPC.

45
00:02:17,393 --> 00:02:22,203
We're going to pop that in the name tag here. And then we need the IPV four CIDR block.

46
00:02:22,214 --> 00:02:24,684
So that's this one here exactly as you see

47
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:28,264
it in the file 10 000 slash 16.

48
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:33,324
Back in the console. We can put this in here where it says IPV four CIDR.

49
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:38,384
Now, we don't need an IPV six CIDR block and the default tenancy is the best option.

50
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:43,505
So that's it. We just create the VPC. So that's it. The VPC has now been created.

51
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:46,244
You can see that we don't actually have any subnets.

52
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:51,794
There is a route table, of course, that's created by default by the VPC creation.

53
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:52,615
Now what we want

54
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:54,906
next is create our subnets.

55
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:59,796
So let's come back to sub nets on the left hand side here, I'm going to create subnets,

56
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,205
choose my VPC.

57
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:04,925
So of course, we need to choose the one we just created my VPC.

58
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:08,225
Then we can add in the subnets one by one.

59
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:10,895
So Subnet, one of one is going to be our first one.

60
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:13,516
I'm going to copy the name, paste that in.

61
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:15,675
You may have noticed that we had a

62
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:18,445
specification for which availability zone in the file.

63
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:20,546
It said US easr one A. So we'll choose us

64
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:22,996
east one A and then let's get the CIDR block.

65
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:26,067
So back in the file, we're now going to copy this CIDR block. So this is

66
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:29,397
a slash 24 10 010 back in the file.

67
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:33,417
Let's just paste that in now I can do exactly the same thing for the next subnet

68
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:38,257
and then repeat that for subnets 2, 3 and four. So I've just done that.

69
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:41,986
I now have all four subnets to find Subnet one there

70
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:45,807
Subnet two public one B in us East one B subnet,

71
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:48,457
three private one A in US East one A

72
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,750
and then finally Subnet four private one B in US East one B.

73
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:55,789
And of course, I've added in the correct side of blocks for each of those.

74
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,850
So now we can create the subnets. It's going to automate that process for us.

75
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,220
And now we have these four new subnets in our VPC.

76
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,539
Let's go over and have a look at the route table configuration.

77
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,589
So we have a route table here for my VPC.

78
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:14,619
It won't have any explicit associations.

79
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,678
So we can see subnets without explicit associations are here. We have four.

80
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,019
So essentially they're implicit associations.

81
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,190
They haven't been statically defined or

82
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:26,959
manually defined against this particular route table.

83
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,950
So there's no explicit subnet associations.

84
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,269
Now,

85
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,739
what we do want to do is create a new route table and

86
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,489
take our private subnets and put those in the new route table.

87
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,589
So let's go back up a level, create rout table in the file here. We've got private RT

88
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:44,049
as the name. It's got to be in the correct VPC

89
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:48,329
Of course, and then we're going to associate private one A and private one B.

90
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:52,179
So let's give it the name, select the VPC and create rout table.

91
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,609
And now we want to go to sub net associations, edit

92
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,320
and then choose private one A and private one B and then save associations.

93
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:04,029
So now we have the explicit subnet associations.

94
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,510
So if we won't go back to the original route table, the default one,

95
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,130
the main route table, we now see there's only two implicit associations.

96
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,380
OK?

97
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,250
There's none explicitly but the private one A and one B have been

98
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,549
moved out to the new route table that's designed for the private subnets.

99
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:24,529
Lastly, we're going to create an internet gateway. So we're going to it my

100
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,109
IGW back in the console, we're going to go to internet gateways,

101
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:32,109
create internet gateway, provide the name and then create it.

102
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:35,910
Now, what we need to do is go to actions and attach to VPC,

103
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,489
select my VPC and then attach internet gateway.

104
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:39,910
So that's it.

105
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,350
The route table creates very quickly if you come back to rout tables,

106
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,570
choose the main route table.

107
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:49,380
That's this one here. In fact, I'm going to give it a name. Let's call this one main Dash

108
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:50,489
RT.

109
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,100
So we know that's the one in

110
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,230
our custom VPC. I'm going to choose the route table ID

111
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,529
and we can see we only have the local route.

112
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,910
So what we want to do is add the route now to the internet gateway,

113
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,130
it's going to be all zeros.

114
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,589
And then we're going to choose internet gateway and select

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,369
my IG W and then save and that's it.

116
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,970
Our custom VPC is now configured.

117
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,730
All that's left to do is launch some EC2 instances and test it out.

118
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:17,450
So let's go to EC2. I'm going to launch an instance.

119
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,549
We're going to use the default Amazon Linux 2023 AMI

120
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,269
T two micro. I'm going to proceed without a key pair.

121
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,690
We're going to choose the correct VPC. So that's the new VPC, my VPC

122
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:35,309
and create a security group. So we'll just call this one web access as we usually do.

123
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,820
In fact, I'm going to add on my VPC on the end.

124
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:40,369
So it's clear sometimes in the console which one

125
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,149
to choose now, what we want to do is just add in any rules.

126
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,890
We've got SSH, let's also add in http from anywhere

127
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,019
and we've got SSH

128
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,529
already by default.

129
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:56,940
So let's launch this instance now that we have our route table set up successfully,

130
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,350
we're going to launch an EC2 instance and test

131
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:03,250
that we can actually access that instance from the internet.

132
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,149
Now, before we do that, what I want to do is head over to subnets,

133
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,470
we're going to choose our public subnets, one by one, go to actions,

134
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,109
edit Subnet settings

135
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:18,385
and enable auto assigned public IPV four address and then click on save.

136
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:20,994
I'll do that one for the other public Subnet as well.

137
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:24,964
We want to make sure that we get those public IP addresses.

138
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,695
OK. Let's save that one.

139
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:30,184
And now we're ready to launch our instance in the course download,

140
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:32,885
we have some user data here, which we're going to use.

141
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:34,725
So let's copy this user data.

142
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:38,125
It's simply going to install a web server under security groups.

143
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:42,945
We're going to create a security group. I'm going to call this web access dash

144
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,730
my VPC and the same in the description as well.

145
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:51,140
So we know which one this is associated with for VPC

146
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:56,730
We're going to select my VPC for inbound rules. We're going to add both SSH

147
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,899
and then http

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,179
and in both cases from anywhere. And that's our security group set up.

149
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,760
Now, let's go to the EC2 management console in EC2.

150
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:11,505
I'm going to launch an instance. I'll leave the default Amazon Linux 2023 MA

151
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:16,795
I T two micro. I don't need to keep air. Of course, we need to change our VPC.

152
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:20,415
So I'm going to choose my VPC, select existing security group,

153
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:23,695
choose web access and then we need to scroll down to advance

154
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:27,375
details all the way to the bottom and paste in our user data

155
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:28,304
and then launch

156
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:34,455
while that's happening. I'm also going to launch an instance into a private subnet.

157
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:34,683
OK.

158
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:37,385
So let's call this one private and I'm just

159
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:40,229
going to scroll down for the instance type.

160
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:43,429
We'll leave it as it is. I don't need a key pair for VPC.

161
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,969
Of course, we need to check, select our my VPC.

162
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:50,989
And then for security group, this one's going to be private access.

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,119
And what I'm going to put into here is simply

164
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:54,960
we can have SSH

165
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,440
but also I want to have the ICMP all, so all ICMP

166
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,669
IPV four from,

167
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:05,419
and we can actually select the security group of our public instance.

168
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:09,145
So that would be the web access, my VPC.

169
00:09:09,304 --> 00:09:13,375
OK. So we're only going to allow IC MP from this security group.

170
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:16,244
Now, we do need to make sure that the subnet is correct as well.

171
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,174
So let's just go and put this into a private subnet.

172
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,294
So I'm going to choose private one A

173
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:24,544
so now it's not going to get a public IP. All right, scroll down.

174
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,765
Let's launch the instance on EC2

175
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,244
I'm going to select my public instance,

176
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:32,864
copy the public IP address and let's put that into a browser

177
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,809
and that works. So that's awesome. That's definitely working.

178
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,429
We know that port 80 from the internet is working.

179
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,890
So we have an internet gateway,

180
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,080
we have a public IP address and we should be able to connect in via SSH

181
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:48,979
as well. So let's use instance connect and now we're connected to our instance.

182
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:53,070
Now what I want to do is send a ping request to the private instance.

183
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,700
So that will check that we connectivity to our private EC2

184
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:57,630
instance.

185
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,030
So we're simply going to run ping,

186
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,510
put in the private IP address and we get a successful response.

187
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,010
So that's it.

188
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,969
I've now tested that my internet gateway and everything is working,

189
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:12,469
routing is working as expected and all that's left to do is

190
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:16,270
just terminate these two instances and we're done for this lesson.
