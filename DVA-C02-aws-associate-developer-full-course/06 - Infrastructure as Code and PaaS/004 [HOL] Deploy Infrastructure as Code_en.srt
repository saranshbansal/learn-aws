1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,440
In this hands-on lesson,

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,150
we're going to deploy some infrastructure through AWS CloudFormation.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,750
In your course download, you'll find three files which are in the code

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,820
and CloudFormation directory.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,810
So you've got Create S3 Bucket CF.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,260
This has got number one in front of it and then there's number two and number three.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,265
So we're going to work with these templates and use these to deploy

8
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:32,150
some infrastructure into CloudFormation.

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,085
Now what we're actually going to deploy is going to be in Amazon S3 bucket.

10
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:39,460
And we're going to apply some configuration to that bucket.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,740
Now there's just one thing you need to do for now

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,440
and that is you need to enter a bucket name where it says enter bucket name.

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,740
Now do make sure it's in lower case because you can't use upper case.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,670
And make sure it's something unique.

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,150
So I've given mine a bucket name which I believe should be unique.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,160
And I'm just going to save my file.

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,239
Now what this file is going to do is very simply deploy the S3 bucket, so we

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,591
can see that this is a very, very simple template written in YAML.

19
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:13,960
We have our resources specified, we have a resource which is in S3 bucket.

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,460
And you can see it's the type AWS::S3::bucket.

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,160
Then we have a description.

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,340
And then we have the properties and there we have simply specified

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,610
the name that we want to apply to the bucket.

24
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,990
There's then some outputs.

25
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,400
Now the outputs are important information because we can use these outputs

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,860
in other stacks or externally.

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,290
So here our output has a description and then it has

28
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,350
a value which is going to be the bucket name.

29
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:45,980
So that's all we need to do here.

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,630
Let's go over to CloudFormation and deploy our S3 bucket.

31
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,260
So I'm logged into CloudFormation here and what we need to do is create a stack.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,560
So I'm going to choose create stack with new resources

33
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,840
and I'm going to select the prepare template

34
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,590
and then upload a template file.

35
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,960
And then we simply need to choose our file.

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,670
So let's choose this number one, create S3BucketCF.yml.

37
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,860
Upload.

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,310
Click on next.

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,460
We need to give it a stack name.

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,560
I'm going to call mine Create Market CloudFormation.

41
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:21,960
Click on next.

42
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,420
Now we have some options to apply things like tags. We can set the permissions.

43
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,570
So the IAM role that's going to be used.

44
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,626
Now note that if you don't choose a role it's going to use the permissions assigned

45
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:36,800
to your account, so your user credentials.

46
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,853
Now I do have the permissions to actually deploy

47
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:42,760
the stack so I don't need to specify a role.

48
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,800
The default stack failure option is to roll back all stacked resources.

49
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,780
So if something during the stack creation process fails,

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,190
CloudFormation will attempt to roll everything back again.

51
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,720
So there's nothing left running.

52
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,650
Doesn't always work so you've got to check but it is a very, very useful feature.

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,860
Now we're not going to apply any advanced options. Let's just click on next.

54
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,360
We can scroll down to the bottom.

55
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,350
We need to select this check box and then choose create stack.

56
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,020
And now our stack creation is in progress.

57
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,870
If you hit refresh you will get the updated status

58
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,260
and here we can see that the creation is complete.

59
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,180
And if we go to outputs, we should now see that we have an output.

60
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,590
And that has the value which is the name of our bucket.

61
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,660
If I go over to Amazon S3

62
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,050
and I'm going to hit on refresh here.

63
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,630
And now we have an extra bucket here.

64
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,740
So this is the bucket that was created by CloudFormation as part of our stack.

65
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,250
You'll also notice that CloudFormation has this templates bucket.

66
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,360
And in here it actually stores the files that it's using.

67
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,590
So it's created two buckets.

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,020
Now, if we go in and have a look at our bucket,

69
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,380
it's going to have some basic settings applied.

70
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,640
If we go to properties, for example,

71
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,580
we can note that there is no default encryption enabled.

72
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,160
that might be something we want to do.

73
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,640
Also, if we go over to permissions and click on edit here,

74
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,090
you'll notice that the setting which is a default

75
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,128
if you actually create your bucket through the console isn't actually selected.

76
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:17,630
So it's not actually blocking public access.

77
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,050
So that's something to think about.

78
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,080
If you use CloudFormation to deploy your S3 buckets you might want to specify

79
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,160
to disable public access in your template.

80
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,410
So what we're actually going to do next is we want to apply

81
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,660
default encryption to our bucket.

82
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,640
So we're going to go back and have a look at

83
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,600
the second template which is going to do that for us.

84
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,180
So this is the template for updating the

85
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,360
bucket to have server-side encryption enabled.

86
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,350
Now don't forget to update your bucket name.

87
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,350
It needs to have the same bucket name as before.

88
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,085
And literally all we've added now is this piece here,

89
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:59,680
so it now has bucket encryption, server-side encryption, configuration,

90
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:06,450
server-side encryption by default, and then the SSE algorithm is AES256.

91
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,240
And that means it's going to use the S3 managed encryption.

92
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,860
So I'm happy with that. Let's save my file and let's go back to CloudFormation

93
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,860
Now, I don't want to create a new stack, I want to update my existing stack.

94
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,010
But let's say that I want to see what the differences are going to be.

95
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,760
You can create a change set.

96
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,090
And with a change set we can actually view what the potential changes will be.

97
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,600
So I'm going to replace my current template,

98
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,560
upload a new template file,

99
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,760
and then choose my file and select number two.

100
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:38,703
Click on upload.

101
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,060
Click on next.

102
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,560
Next again.

103
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,050
And leave the default options

104
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,660
and then go through to create our change set, and you need to check this box here.

105
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,360
So let's create change set.

106
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,650
I will accept the default name

107
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,650
and create change set.

108
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,530
Now, this won't take long. It should take 30 seconds or so to complete.

109
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,140
Now, it's actually completed in probably about five or 10 seconds.

110
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,390
So very, very fast.

111
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,140
Now we can see that the changes are that there's going to be a modification.

112
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,420
Doesn't really tell us too much detail.

113
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,860
Depending on what resources you're updating, sometimes you can get more detail.

114
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,780
But if you go to the JSON changes here, we can see here that the target

115
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:29,160
is bucket encryption, so we're updating the encryption status of our bucket.

116
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,230
So I'm happy with that.

117
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,150
I can execute my change set now that I know what's going to happen.

118
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,780
And that didn't take long. That update has now completed.

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,440
Let's go back over to look at our bucket.

120
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,385
I'm just going to refresh the page and now we can see that default encryption

121
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,060
is enabled for our bucket.

122
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,500
The last thing I want to do is I want to enable versioning for my bucket.

123
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,060
So now I'm going to run another template,

124
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,190
make sure to update your bucket name as before.

125
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,300
And this time we've got the previous settings applied

126
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,260
but then also we have this versioning configuration here.

127
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,740
And that status is enabled.

128
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,020
Now there's actually one more thing I want to do.

129
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,200
I want to make sure that when I delete my stack, it doesn't delete my bucket.

130
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,600
So sometimes you might want your CloudFormation stack to roll back

131
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,230
everything that it's done and delete the resources that it's created.

132
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,110
Other times you might want to make sure that doesn't happen.

133
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,960
So you can use the deletion policy and specify retain.

134
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,790
So I'm going to put in deletion policy, colon space

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,560
and then we're going to put retain.

136
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,470
And now I'm going to save my template.

137
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,660
And let's go back to CloudFormation.

138
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,260
Let's go back to find our stack.

139
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,250
Click on update this time and I'm going to update it directly.

140
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,760
Choose to upload a template file, choose my file and select number three.

141
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,860
Upload.

142
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,160
And then again we just go through with the default settings

143
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:04,360
and finally we can update our stack after selecting the checkbox.

144
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,260
So let's update the stack.

145
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,480
So that's done. Let's go back to our bucket and the versioning should now be enabled.

146
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,060
So let's just refresh the page.

147
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,460
And we have versioning.

148
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,130
Now, what if I actually change one of the

149
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,350
settings that's been applied through the template?

150
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,650
Let's go into default encryption and I'm going to disable that change.

151
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,310
Now if I go back to CloudFormation,

152
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,350
go to stack actions, detect drift,

153
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,919
and what it's going to do is it's going to

154
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,020
have a look at the last template that we uploaded

155
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,760
and it's going to check if the actual configuration of

156
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,250
our bucket differs from the configuration specified in the template.

157
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,090
So that's happening in the background. Let's go to view drift results.

158
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,570
And we can see that the status is modified. Again, it really depends on the resource.

159
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,170
Sometimes you get more information that you can use but at least I know now that the

160
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,230
configuration of the bucket does not match my

161
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,200
template so I can do some more analysis.

162
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,450
Now I'm finished with this stack. So what I want to do is simply go in

163
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,760
and delete my stack.

164
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,650
Now, what should happen because we set the deletion policy to retain

165
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,650
is it should complete fairly quickly but it's not going to delete our bucket.

166
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,760
So let's go back and make sure that our bucket is still there.

167
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,570
And it is. So that's all worked successfully.

168
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,330
So that's it for this lesson. We'll do another hands-on shortly.

169
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,760
And that will have a much more complex stack.
