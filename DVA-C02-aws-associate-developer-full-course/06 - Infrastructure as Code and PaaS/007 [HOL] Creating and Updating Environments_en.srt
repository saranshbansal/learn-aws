00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,810
Hi guys in this lesson,

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,860
we're going to create an application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk

3
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,850
and then we're going to see how we can update that application.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,163
I'm logged into AWS and I'm on the Elastic Beanstalk page.

5
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:22,060
And what I'm going to do is use the create application button here.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,850
Now what we need to do first is provide an application name.

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,960
So I'm going to call my application My Beanstalk Test.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,390
And if I scroll down a little way, we then have the choose platform.

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,860
Now I'm going to choose Node.js.

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,180
I'm going to leave the defaults here.

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,210
But then I'm going to choose to actually upload my own code.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,250
So let's scroll down

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,480
and I'm going to choose a file.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,090
And what I'm gonna do is in my course download, go to the Elastic Beanstalk directory

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,550
and choose this Node.js.zip.

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,410
Click on upload.

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,710
So now we can simply create our application.

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,980
Now, if you wanted to apply some more advanced configurations,

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,170
you can choose to configure more options.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,500
In here we can define various different things. So firstly we've got some presets.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,960
Presets for single instance with free tier eligibility,

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,560
we can create highly available infrastructure,

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,431
and we can use high availability with spot and on-demand instances,

24
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,460
or our own custom configuration.

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,960
We can enable things like the X-ray daemon for tracing our application.

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,310
We can configure information about our instances,

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,240
the capacity, so what instance types we want to use and the image ID, etc.

28
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,680
And of course we can add load balancers.

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,880
So in a highly available configuration we would

30
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:52,285
have multiple instances and a load balancer.

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,530
So there's quite a bit you can do there. I'm not going to change any of those settings.

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,560
Let's just go and create our application.

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,200
So that's being created and we can see the progress happening on our screen here.

34
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,060
And it can take several minutes with Elastic Beanstalk for it to complete.

35
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,410
So it's been a few minutes and my application appears to be deployed now.

36
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,780
And what I can do to check is we've got this URL here. So I can click on this URL.

37
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,600
And it should take me to this landing page, which is the Node.js landing page.

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,160
So this is a default document that gets shown.

39
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,760
So that looks good. That looks like my application has correctly installed.

40
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,310
Now, as you can see on the left hand side here,

41
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,290
we have a couple of different places that we can configure options.

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,960
Firstly, we have the application which is here.

43
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,050
And you can see the application versions.

44
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,160
We only have one at this stage.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,860
Then we actually have the environments which are part of the application.

46
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,783
So here you can see the environment

47
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:55,750
and the various different configuration options for environment.

48
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,520
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to upload a new version of our application

49
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,760
and we're going to make a modification to the code that we used before to do that.

50
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,110
I'm in the file system of my computer here and looking at the Node.js.zip file.

51
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,860
What you need to do is just unzip that file

52
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,860
and then go into the Node.js directory.

53
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,520
And in here we'll find a few files.

54
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,900
Now what I want to do is I'm going to edit the index.html.

55
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,960
and I'm going to use visual studio code.

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,030
So here is my file.

57
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,960
Now what I'm going to do is scroll down a little way

58
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,000
to the area where I see this background color and it's green.

59
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,460
Now, we're going to copy over this

60
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,230
and we're going to put in blue.

61
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,060
And as we do so we have the option come up here.

62
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,760
So that's how I want it to look.

63
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,880
I'm going to save my document.

64
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,590
and now here's the really important thing. We need to zip this up again.

65
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,950
But I don't want you to zip this folder.

66
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,643
You must take the files and zip the files.

67
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:10,105
Now I'm on a Mac and the way I do that is I highlight them all and then compress.

68
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:13,560
You might be using Winzip or some other utility on your computer.

69
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,060
But just make sure you select the files.

70
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,050
So I've got this archive, I'm just going to bring it up to this directory.

71
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,550
And I'm going to rename it to Node.js-bue.

72
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,350
Back in the Elastic Beanstalk console I'm going to choose upload and deploy,

73
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,760
choose a file,

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,180
choose My Node.js Blue, click on upload.

75
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,260
It's going to give it a version label and we can see here it says source-1.

76
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,460
So let's click on deploy.

77
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,520
And that should just take a few minutes.

78
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,890
So remember this is how our web application looks at the moment.

79
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,050
And what we're trying to do is change this here to green.

80
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,090
So that's taking place, just give it a couple of minutes

81
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,570
and then it should be updated.

82
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,500
Now in the meantime, if you've got EC2 open,

83
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,400
you should be able to find your instance running here.

84
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,190
So in EC2, we can see our beanstalk instances.

85
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,350
It has a name so mine is named after the environment that we created.

86
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,390
So you can interact with your EC2 instances and you can manage them as well.

87
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,270
As long as you add a key pair during the creation,

88
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,980
which is something we actually didn't do,

89
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,000
But if you do do that then you're able to

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,960
actually use that key pair to access your instance.

91
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,020
So let's go back and just watch the status and once it's complete,

92
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,060
we'll test our application again.

93
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,158
So I've just noticed that it now says instance deployment completed successfully.

94
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:43,010
Hasn't quite got the health information back yet.

95
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,060
But if we come back to our web application here,

96
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,060
refresh and now it's turned blue.

97
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,460
So that's worked as expected.

98
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,880
Now back in Beanstalk we should now

99
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,060
see that we have these different application versions.

100
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,160
And you can see the different code.

101
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,040
So if you wanted to, you could now revert back,

102
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,310
you can always change back to a different version.

103
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,950
So for example I can choose this option, go to deploy,

104
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,660
and it's going to actually redeploy the original code.

105
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,000
So these exist independently of the actual application that's running.

106
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,010
And they're there so that you have a history of the source code

107
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,460
that you can always go back to a previous version if something goes wrong.

108
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,760
So that should now be updating again. Let's go back to our environment.

109
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,080
And that appears to have completed.

110
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,550
So let's go back, refresh, and now we're back to where we were.

111
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,390
And that's it for this lesson. We've finished with this environment.

112
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,350
So what I'm going to do is simply go to actions and terminate environment.

113
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,560
Now you do need to then copy the name of the environment and paste that in

114
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,110
and then terminate.

115
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,970
Now this won't actually delete the application, it deletes the environment.

116
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,820
That is the EC2 instance as well.

117
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,708
So the EC2 instance will be terminated

118
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,868
but the application configuration is there so we can then

119
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:09,260
create new environment. So we will do that later on in this section.
