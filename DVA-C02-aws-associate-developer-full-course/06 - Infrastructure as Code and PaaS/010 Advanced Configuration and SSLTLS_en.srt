1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,060
There are a few additional advanced configuration options

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,460
in Beanstalk that are subjects on the exam, as well as using certificates.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,100
So firstly we're going to start off with something called the .ebextensions.

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,810
Now you can add Elastic Beanstalk configuration files

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,300
these are the, in the .ebextensions directory to your web application source code to

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,360
configure your environment and customize the resources it contains.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,691
The configuration files are YAML or JSON-formatted documents

8
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:37,860
with .config file extension.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,585
And you put them in a folder that is named .ebextensions and deploy

10
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,810
that in your application source code.

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,210
So for example,

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,230
here we have some options settings for an Elastic Beanstalk environment

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,590
with our load balancer type being a network load balancer.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,085
Now the option_settings section of a configuration file

15
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,260
defines the values for configuration options.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,060
The resources section allows you to further customize the resources

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,438
and define additional resources beyond the functionality

18
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:11,490
provided in the configuration options.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,360
So you get a lot more flexibility here and scope for customization.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,780
Additional sections of the configuration file will

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,260
let you configure the instances that are launched in your environment.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,863
They include the packages, sources, files, users, groups, commands,

23
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:30,950
container_commands, and services.

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,280
Again, this definitely comes up in exam questions to make sure you

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,500
understand that this is a way to customize Elastic Beanstalk.

26
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,403
Remember that .ebextensions is
a directory and within that directory

27
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:45,958
you then have your .config files.

28
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:50,450
And you've got to include .ebextensions within your source code bundle.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,850
So next, using HTTPS with Elastic Beanstalk.

30
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,700
You can use SSL/TLS certificates.

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,260
They can be assigned to an environment Elastic Load Balancer.

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,050
You can use AWS certificate manager for managing those certificates.

33
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:11,540
The connections between clients and the load balancer are then secured with SSL/TLS.

34
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,450
Backend connections between the load balancer and EC2 instances are not secured.

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,220
You can configure the certificate through the console or through the .ebextensions.

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,020
So for example here you can see we have an option_settings parameter

37
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,510
and within that we're defining our secure listener,

38
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,960
we're enabling it on port 443 for the HTTPS protocol.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,440
And then we've got the ARN for our SSL/TLS certificate.

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,380
Now if you do want end-to-end encryption so you

41
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,510
want encryption not just from the client to the load balancer,

42
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,550
but from the load balancer to the EC2 instances, then you can do that.

43
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,570
You can use a self-signed certificate on the EC2 instances.

44
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,060
And again the configuration can be made using .ebextensions.

45
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,150
How you actually configure it is dependent on which load balancer you're using.

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,580
So let's have a look at an example.

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,770
So here we're going to have a file called HTTPS  Re-encrypt-ALB.

48
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,160
It's a .config file. It's in .ebextensions.

49
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,720
It's got some option settings defined

50
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,040
and we can see that we've got the listener being defined on our ELB.

51
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,860
And then we've got the port and the protocol for the backend as well.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,020
You may want to redirect any incoming HTTP connections to HTTPS.

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,700
And there's a couple of ways to do this.

54
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,680
One way is you can use the instance web service configuration.

55
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,110
So you're actually configuring the web service on your EC2 instances

56
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,970
to respond to any HTTP traffic with an HTTP redirection response status.

57
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,360
And the configuration for that is platform dependent.

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,560
Next you could use the load balancers, so you can configure an ALB

59
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,060
to send redirection responses to HTTP traffic. Now, that is specific to the ALB.

60
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,920
And that's it for this lesson. I will see you in the next one.
