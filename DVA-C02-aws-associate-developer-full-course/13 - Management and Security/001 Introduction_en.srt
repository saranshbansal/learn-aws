Hi guys and welcome to this section.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,600
This section is on the AWS management services as well as some security services.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,050
So we're going to look at things like performance monitoring

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,860
tools like amazon cloudwatch auditing tools like AWS cloud trail

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,110
services for creating and managing encryption keys like the

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,470
key management service.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,060
And we're also going to look at services for storing our secrets,

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,600
including parameter store and AWS secrets manager.

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,630
Those are ways that we can store things

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,830
like database connection credentials or passwords or access keys

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,020
so that they're securely stored and can be accessed via an API call.

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,860
And lastly, we'll look at amazon Cognito,

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,960
a service that doesn't come up too often in an exam but we'll cover some basic theory.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,160
Cognito is used for enabling Sign in and sign up for mobile applications.

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,860
So I hope you enjoy it. And I'll see you in the next lesson.
