00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,580
In this lesson, we're going to go and have a look at CloudWatch logs and a few of the features.

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:15,700
So back in CloudWatch, on the left hand side we have logs and then log groups and log insights.

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,200
Let's choose log groups.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,960
Now we've already logged quite a few times.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,990
Sometimes you wouldn't have realized it in this course because the applications that we created automatically

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,900
logs to CloudWatch Logs. For example, our Fargate cluster sent some information here

7
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,890
based on the performance. We can actually see that there's telemetry data.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,470
Now, you can also see that the retention varies. So that information has expired now because it was only

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,820
held here for one day.

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,700
You can also set it to never expire or whatever value you want, like five days, for example.

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:55,060
The top level here is the log group. And you can see through this hierarchy what service is being referenced.

12
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,110
So here we have AWS Lambda and then a function.

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,350
So, all of the information related to that function will be in here.

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,190
We have another one here, the product visits data handler, which is from an earlier lesson in the

15
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,120
serverless section.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,290
If we go into the log group, you'll then find the log streams.

17
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,710
If you open the log streams, you then get the log events.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,150
Each series of events will have a start, an end, and a report.

19
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,230
And then in the middle you might have these info events as well.

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,560
So, if you expand the start, then it just simply gives you some information on the request and a timestamp.

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,510
The end tells you when it finished with a timestamp and a request ID.

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,660
And then the report in this case gives you information such as the duration that the function ran,

23
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,940
the build duration, and the memory size.

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,370
And then you also see these info events.

25
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,290
Here you can see the JSON code that went into the SQS message.

26
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,520
And then the next one along shows the JSON of the actual product that was purchased through our online

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:01:59,910
store.

28
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,090
Back up a level, we can see we have a few additional features.

29
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,110
Metric filters allow you to monitor events in your log group and do things like counting the specific

30
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,500
terms or values that are coming up in the log data.

31
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,410
Then we have subscription filters. Here

32
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,090
if we create a subscription filter, we get to choose from a few different services.

33
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,710
We've got ElasticSearch, we've got Kinesis, Kinesis Firehose, and Lambda.

34
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,620
And that means that the information as it comes in the CloudWatch logs is going to get forwarded to

35
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,710
the subscribers like an AWS Lambda function, which then might want to process that data as it

36
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,280
arrives.

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,350
Now, I also want to show you the log insights. Within logs insights,

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,780
what you can do is select your log groups.

39
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,120
So let's say that we select several different log groups here, and then you can run a query.

40
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:58,950
And this particular query is going to find the most recent 20 events from across the log groups. So, we

41
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,900
can choose a time.

42
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,630
I'm going to use absolute and let's just put in the last few weeks and then click on run query.

43
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:13,260
And what we get is the most recent 20 events that have been logged into CloudWatch logs.

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,020
And of course, you could just go and change that to 200 or whatever you want, and you can run all

45
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,120
sorts of other queries with logs insights.

46
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,630
So, logs insights is a great way of finding those insights into whatever's happening in your logging.

47
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,630
So, that's all I wanted to cover in this hands-on lesson.

48
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,620
I'll see you in the next one.
