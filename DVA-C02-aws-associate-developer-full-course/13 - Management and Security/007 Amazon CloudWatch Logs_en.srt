00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,820
In this lesson, we're going to look at cloudwatch logs.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,280
So Cloudwatch logs is used to gather and centralize application and system logs

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,610
in Cloudwatch. So these can come from your applications from system logs.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,330
They can come from AWS services and they can

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,940
come from on premises systems with the agent installed.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,580
You can define expiration policies and you can enable encryption using a KMS key.

7
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:33,105
You can send data to Amazon S3, that's an export

8
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:34,735
kinesis data streams

9
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:36,745
and kinesis data firehose.

10
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:38,595
So we've got cloudwatch logs here,

11
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:39,775
EC2

12
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,185
on the left hand side

13
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:43,935
and some on premises systems on the right hand side,

14
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:49,065
the unified Cloudwatch agent is installed on EC2 and on the on premises servers.

15
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:50,115
And then

16
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:53,835
those different servers can send information to Cloudwatch logs

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,140
that includes application logs

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,440
and system logs.

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,030
AWS LAMBDA can also send

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,190
to cloudwatch logs and it will require permissions to cloudwatch logs.

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:04,810
So remember,

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,340
you've always got to make sure you give the right permissions to LAMBDA.

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,000
Now, information from Cloudwatch logs

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,690
can be sent to

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,900
the Amazon Elasticsearch service as well and you

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,240
get real time log processing with subscription filters

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,040
that can apply also to lambda

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,190
and kinesis.

29
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,110
So let's have a look at some features of cloudwatch.

30
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,840
Cloudwatch logs insights can be used to interactively search and analyze

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,530
the log data in cloudwatch logs.

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,150
You can monitor applications and systems using log data.

33
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,480
You can create alarms based on API activity

34
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,540
that's captured by cloud trail.

35
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,520
By default, the logs are kept indefinitely so they don't expire,

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,040
but you can adjust the retention period for each log group.

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,060
And that can range from one day to 10 years of retention.

38
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,630
Cloudwatch logs can also be used to log information about DNS queries

39
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,270
that are received by the Amazon route 53 service.

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,360
Now, some of the core concepts, of course, we've got log events,

41
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,860
that's a record of activity recorded by a service that's monitored.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,120
Log streams are a sequence of log events that share the same source

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,450
log groups are groups of log streams that share the same retention monitoring

44
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,440
and access control settings.

45
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,470
Metric filters are used to extract metric observations from ingested events

46
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,700
and transform them to data points

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,370
in a cloudwatch metric.

48
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,040
And then lastly,

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,090
the retention settings specify how long events are kept in cloudwatch logs.
