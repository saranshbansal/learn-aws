00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,290
Hi guys welcome to the exam cram for management and security.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,050
So let's get into IT.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,320
Cloudwatch is used for performing monitoring alarms,

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,590
log collection and automated actions.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:22,460
Core features are cloudwatch metrics. Cloudwatch alarms, Cloudwatch logs

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,100
and cloudwatch events

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,690
metrics are sent to cloudwatch for many AWS services.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,610
Ec two metrics are sent every five minutes by default and that is free or you enable

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,710
detailed monitoring and then they get sent every one minute and you have to pay a fee.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,510
Unified Cloudwatch agent sends system level metrics

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,260
for easy to and on premises servers.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,850
They include memory and disk usage.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,600
The unified cloudwatch agent enables you to do the following,

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,000
collect those internal system level metrics for your ec.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,960
Two instances across operating systems

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,770
collect system level metrics from on premises servers

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,270
retrieve custom metrics from your applications or services using the stats.

18
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,260
D and collect the protocols

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,350
and collect logs from ec. Two instances

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,300
and on premises service for Windows and Linux.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,110
The agent must be installed on the server. It can be installed on ec. Two on premises.

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,960
Windows server or Mac. Os.

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,280
Cloud trail logs aPI activity for auditing

24
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,660
by default management events are logged and retained for 90 days.

25
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:38,150
A cloud trail trail logs any events to s free for then indefinite retention.

26
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,460
A trial can be within a region or it can span all regions.

27
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,050
Cloudwatch events can be triggered based on aPI calls that are logged in.

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,860
Cloud trail

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,290
events can be extreme to cloudwatch logs.

30
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,260
Management events provide information about management operations that

31
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,140
are performed on resources in your account.

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,790
We then have data events. These provide

33
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,050
information about the resource operations performed on or within a resource

34
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,590
insights.

35
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,550
Events identify and respond to unusual activity associated with write

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,000
aPI calls by continuously analyzing cloud trail management events.

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,210
Kms keys are the primary resources

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,800
in AWS key management service.

39
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,750
They used to be known as customer master keys or C. M. K. S.

40
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,860
The KMs key also contains the key material used to encrypt and decrypt data

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,490
by default, KMs creates the key material for a KMs key.

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,250
You can also import your own key material.

43
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,450
A. K. Meskhi can encrypt data up to four kB in size.

44
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,390
A KMs key can generate encrypt and decrypt data encryption keys.

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,930
Automatic rotation generates new key material every year

46
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,770
and that's optional for customer managed keys.

47
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,400
It's supported for symmetric keys with key material that AWS KMs creates

48
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,250
to share snapshots with another account.

49
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,050
You must specify decrypt and create grant permissions.

50
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,110
The KMs via service condition key

51
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,660
can be used to limit key usage to specific AWS services, cryptographic.

52
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,830
Ihr asia means removing the ability to decrypt data and you can

53
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,660
achieve that by using imported key material and deleting that key material.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,950
You must use the delete imported key material A. P. I. To remove the key material

55
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,250
and invalid key I. D. Exception when using the S. S. M. Parameter store

56
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,060
indicates the KMs key is not enabled.

57
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,770
Make sure you know the differences between AWS managed and

58
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:48,150
customer managed KMs keys and automatic versus manual rotation.

59
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,360
That's super important for the exam.

60
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,610
Systems manager parameter store provides secure hierarchical

61
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,470
storage for configuration data and secrets.

62
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,520
It's highly scalable, available and durable.

63
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,720
You can store data such as passwords, database strings and license codes

64
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,270
as parameter values.

65
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,760
It will store values as plaintext, unencrypted data or cipher text,

66
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,050
which is encrypted data.

67
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,250
It stores and rotates secrets safely without the need for code deployments.

68
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,440
We then have Secrets Manager,

69
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,130
it offers automatic rotation of credentials and that's built in

70
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,160
for RDS with these specific engines

71
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,500
or red shift

72
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,740
amazon document DB

73
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,630
and for other services you can write

74
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,630
your own lambda function for automatic rotation.

75
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,140
A cognito user pool is a directory for managing

76
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,650
sign in and sign up for mobile applications.

77
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,580
Users can also sign

78
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,380
in using social I. D. P. S.

79
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,380
Cognito acts as an identity broker between the I. D. P. And AWS

80
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,700
identity pools are used to obtain temporary

81
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,950
limited privilege credentials for accessing AWS services

82
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,270
identities can come from a cognito user pool

83
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,510
and they can also come from Social I. D. P s.

84
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,650
Identity paul's used the security token service to obtain the credentials

85
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,890
and I am role is then assumed providing access to the AWS services

86
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,060
and that's it for this exam Crown
