Hi, guys.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,700
Before we get started creating our accounts, I'm just going to walk you through what the process is

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,180
and a little bit of information about what the account includes.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,470
So what you're going to need when you sign up to us is a credit card and you're going to need a unique

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,220
email address.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,030
So one that has not been used to create any other accounts, then with these two things through the

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,960
signup process aways is going to create the account for you.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,870
Now, when you sign in to the account, you'll be signing in using the account root user.

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:46,320
The root user has full control over the account and you use the email address you signed up with to

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,540
log in as the account root user.

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:56,990
Now you can also use the Identity and Access Management Service to create users, groups, roles and

12
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,110
permissions policies, and you should be using those to log in.

13
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:08,720
So, for example, the best thing to do is to create your own individual user accounts in IAM and log

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,310
in as that account.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,910
The root user account is very powerful and it's an IAM best practice to create individual users and

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,550
avoid using the root account if you can.

17
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,580
Now we'll look in more detail at what users, groups, roles and policies are and how they're used within

18
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,240
the course.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,400
But for now, just understand that when you create your account you'll be using the root user account.

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,780
When you initially log in.

21
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,410
When we log into our US accounts, for example, using the management console, we get authenticated.

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,230
It's the identity and access management principles that are used to authenticate IAM, whether you're

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:52,760
using the management console, the API for programmatic access or the command line interface, then

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,300
authorization happens and authorization is the process of determining what you're allowed to do.

25
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:07,310
So for example, you may be able to create resources across different regions around the world and all

26
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:13,700
of those resources are created within the AWS account and all of the identities you're using, like

27
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,600
the users, the groups, the roles and the policies are within the account.
