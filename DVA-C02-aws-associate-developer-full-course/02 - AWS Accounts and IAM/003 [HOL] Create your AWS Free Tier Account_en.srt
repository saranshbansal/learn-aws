00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,790
Hey, guys, and welcome to this hands on lesson.

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,020
In this lesson, we're going to create an awareness free tier account.

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,700
So what are you going to need?

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,620
You will need a credit card for setting up the account and paying any bills.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:25,460
You'll need a unique email address for this account that shouldn't be used with any other US accounts.

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,540
But it's okay if your credit card has been used with other accounts.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,070
Now just as a tip.

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,740
Depending on your email provider, you may be able to use something called a dynamic alias.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:44,390
So for example, if your email is John at gmail.com, you can create a dynamic alias that looks like

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,020
this.

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:52,430
You would write John plus and then you would have some unique name and then at gmail.com.

12
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,430
In this case what I'm using is the alias for my AWS account, which will come to in a moment.

13
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:05,360
Then if I create additional accounts, I can just put that alias in or maybe add a two on the end.

14
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:12,890
Now the account name and alias needs to be unique across us and you'll see how we create that shortly.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,040
Lastly, you need a phone to receive an SMS verification code, so that's all you need.

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,150
Let's get on with it.

17
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:26,180
The easiest way to find the right web page is to search for a free to in Google.

18
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,600
And the very first result here is where we need to go.

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,310
So here we can create our free tier accounts.

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:40,940
Now you'll see that what a US offers is there's 12 months free for many US services.

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,580
There's also a free tier for some services on an ongoing basis or a certain amount of the resources

22
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,540
you can use.

23
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,560
Now, if you scroll down a little way, you can see what comes with the free tier and it's really generous.

24
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:03,340
We get 750 hours a month of Amazon EC2, but we've got to make sure we use the right instance type so

25
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,750
we don't get charged.

26
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:14,230
Now you can see you get five gigabytes of storage on Amazon, S3 750 hours of ads and 25 gigabytes on

27
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,400
the Dynamo DB database service.

28
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,240
So we get a really large amount of resources that we can use, and it's usually more than enough for

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,130
the exercises in the course.

30
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,460
So let's click Create a free tier account.

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:34,120
Now, on this page, which is the normal sign in page, we just click create a new AWS account.

32
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:40,690
Now the very first thing it asks for is a root user email address, and this is going to be the address

33
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,330
we sign in with as the root user after we've created our account.

34
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,460
So make sure you have an email address that is unique.

35
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,150
On AWS, we also need to provide an account name.

36
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:59,680
So this I've called Neil Dash AWS Dash Labs and you can change this after you've signed up.

37
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,390
So I'm ready to go.

38
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,880
I'm going to click on Verify email address.

39
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,160
I've now been emailed a verification code and I need to put that in and click on Verify.

40
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:16,450
After the verification, we need to enter a strong root user password and then confirm it before continuing

41
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,400
on this page of the sign up.

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,020
We need to enter some contacts information.

43
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,470
Now the first thing you need to do is choose personal because we're using this for our own purposes.

44
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,030
Then enter all of your personal information and click on Continue.

45
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,210
Next, we need to enter our billing information.

46
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:41,380
So enter in your credit card details and then click on Verify and continue on step four or five.

47
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,420
You need to enter your phone number, enter the characters from the security check, and then click

48
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,090
send SMS so they can verify that your phone number is working on the last page.

49
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,440
After you've verified your phone number is to choose a support plan.

50
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,690
Now you don't need to pay for support.

51
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,480
You can choose the basic support free and then just choose complete sign up and that's it.

52
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,170
We have actually created our AWS account.

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,360
Now, as you can see on the page here, it says that they're activating your account and it should only

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,470
take a few minutes.

55
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,810
So what you need to do is watch out for the email in your inbox and once you receive it, you can go

56
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,710
and log into your AWS account as the root user.

57
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,200
Now, mine came through very quickly, so I'm going to click on this option to go to the AWS management

58
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,980
console.

59
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,460
Now, as you can see, the first thing you need to do is enter your account ID or account alias.

60
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,730
Now this is actually when you're logging in as an IAM user.

61
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,490
Now we're not doing that yet.

62
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,070
What we need to do now is actually sign in as the root user using the email address we signed up with.

63
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,220
So choose sign in using root user email.

64
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,260
Then you need to enter the email that you used when you signed up and click on next.

65
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,440
Then enter your password and click on sign in.

66
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,760
Okay, so that's it.

67
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,900
We are now signed in to the US management console.

68
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,690
Now, as you can see in the top right hand corner, we can see the name that I gave to the account,

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,230
Neil Dash Dash Labs in this case, and I've got the Northern Virginia region selected.

70
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:23,320
Now for most of the hands on exercises we do, you'll need to be in the Northern Virginia region.

71
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,180
We'll talk more about regions and see how we can use them later on in the course.

72
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:36,490
So from here you can now access the US services using this menu in the top left hand corner, for example,

73
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,240
you can go to compute and then find services like EC2.

74
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,020
So that's it.

75
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,610
We're in our AWS account ready to start using it and that's it for this lesson.

76
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,200
I'll see you in the next lesson where we're actually going to start configuring our account.
