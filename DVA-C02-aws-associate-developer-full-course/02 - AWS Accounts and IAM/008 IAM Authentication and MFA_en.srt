1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:13,250
In this lesson, we're going to explore the authentication options in AWS and also Multi-Factor Authentication,

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,180
or MFA.

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,120
So we have a user account here called John.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,270
Now John wants to log into AWS.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:27,950
He does so through using his username and a password, and potentially an MFA token, which we'll talk about

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,180
more just in a moment.

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:35,660
Once he's then authenticated, he can then get access to the management console and perform operations

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,440
in the console.

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:44,390
Now, the other methods of accessing AWS are the CLI and the API and the SDK, which also leverages

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,170
the API.

11
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:52,910
When you access AWS by one of these methods, you use something called an access key ID and a secret

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,810
access key.

13
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,570
Now, they look like these codes here, so they're a bit more ugly, not as user friendly as a username

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,290
and password.

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:08,790
But these are then used in your code to authenticate to AWS and through to the API so that you can do whatever

16
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,740
you want to do in AWS.

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,120
These are known as access keys, and they're used for programmatic access. We'll create some access keys

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,670
a bit later on in the course and see how we can use them.

19
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:28,420
Now, the other thing I wanted to talk about here is Multi-Factor Authentication or MFA. In IT security,

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,220
we often talk about having different factors of authentication, and authentication is just proving who

21
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:35,760
you are.

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,540
So a way that you can do that is through something you know, and something you know is a password.

23
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:50,610
If you log in to any kind of IT service using a username and password, the username is something which

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,520
multiple people might know, but the password is something that you alone should know.

25
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,090
So that's the secret, and that's the thing that proves that you are who you say you are.

26
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,530
Another factor of authentication is something you have. In this case,

27
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:12,360
you have a physical device like a token or a device that generates a code, and only you can know that

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,860
code and only because you have in your possession that physical device.

29
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,930
Lastly, there's something you are.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:26,340
This is biometrics like fingerprints or retina scans. And we don't use these in AWS, but we do use

31
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,050
the first two. And that's why we have multiple factors of authentication.

32
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:38,640
So, in AWS, we use something you know, your IAM user account and a password and then something you

33
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,150
have.

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:47,430
And that's either a virtual MFA device such as Google Authenticator on your mobile phone or a physical

35
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,000
MFA device, which is an actual physical token.

36
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,280
And I've got a little dollar sign there because they do cost money, whereas Google Authenticator is

37
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,150
completely free.

38
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,110
Now, the physical tokens can be purchased from third parties.

39
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,520
So when you go into the console, if you choose the option to actually use a physical token, you can

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,090
see it there.

41
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,310
You can see an option to click and purchase,

42
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,700
but it will take you off to another website like Amazon.com.

43
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,890
So remember that for the exam. The physical tokens come from third parties.

44
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,570
So that's the theory.

45
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,630
And in the next lesson, we're going to secure our accounts by enabling Multi-Factor Authentication.
