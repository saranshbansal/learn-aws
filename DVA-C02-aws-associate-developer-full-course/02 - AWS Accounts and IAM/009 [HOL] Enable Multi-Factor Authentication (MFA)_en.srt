1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,330
In this lesson, we're going to add multifactor authentication to our own individual user account.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,800
So let's head over to AWS.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,680
I'm in the Identity and Access Management console.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,580
And as you can see, we've already got a couple of security recommendations.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,080
It's saying that we should add MFA for the root user and for ourselves.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,940
Now what we're going to do in this lesson is add MFA for our own user accounts.

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:37,030
Now, the process is very similar but slightly different for the root user. I've actually added a link

8
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:43,450
to an AWS article that you can follow if you want to log out and log back in as root and add MFA

9
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:43,810
or root.

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,050
So that's something you could potentially do after this lesson.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,270
Now it's important to note that with IAM, we never need to select a region. So that's something that

12
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,190
pops up in exam questions quite a lot.

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:00,130
Where you get some kind of scenario, where users are being added to some other geographical area in

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,300
the world and you need to know what to do with their accounts and how to set up their accounts.

15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:11,020
Well, with IAM, you only ever have the accounts in one place and you can use those accounts with any

16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,100
region around the world.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,740
So let's set up MFA for our user account.

18
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:21,910
I'm going to click on users, select my user account, then click on security credentials, and we can

19
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,890
see towards the middle of the screen here

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,200
next to assigned MFA device,

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,190
we don't have any assigned devices. So, I'm going to click on manage.

22
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,700
We're going to use a virtual MFA device. Now,

23
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,880
for this, you will need an authenticator app installed on your mobile device or on your computer.

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,170
Now I personally use the Google Authenticator app on my phone.

25
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,560
So if you don't already have one installed, install the Google Authenticator app and then click on

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,130
continue.

27
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,950
The next thing to do is click show QR code.

28
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,020
You'll need to point your phone's camera to the QR code, and it should open Google Authenticator.

29
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,690
Once you've done that and you've got Google Authenticator open, it should be generating a code and

30
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,070
displaying that on your screen.

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,759
So what you need to do is add the code that's on the screen right now.

32
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:16,200
I've added mine. And then you need to wait for that code to expire and it'll generate a new code and

33
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,390
you need to add that into the MFA code two box and then click on assign MFA.

34
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,940
And that's it.

35
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:28,150
You've now got MFA enabled for your accounts, and you can see that we have an ARN for the virtual

36
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,840
device here.

37
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,740
So next time you log in, you will also be asked to supply the code from your authenticator app.
