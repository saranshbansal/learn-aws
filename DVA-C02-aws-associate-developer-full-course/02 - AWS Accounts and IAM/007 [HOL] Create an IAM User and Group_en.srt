Hi, guys.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,040
And this lesson we're going to create an IAM user and a group.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,520
So I'm logged in to the management console and I'm logged in as my route user account because we don't

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,500
have an IM user yet.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:26,630
So what I'm going to do is search for I am in the top left in the search box and then choose the IAM

6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,470
service.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:35,480
So in IAM we're going to create a user and that user is going to have full permissions to the AWS account

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,990
and we're going to assign the permissions through a group.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:45,620
Now we're going to do this so that we can log into our accounts using our own personal IAM user instead

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,610
of the root user.

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,610
So the first thing I want to do is go to user groups and I'm going to create a group called Admins.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,710
So I'm going to choose, create group, and I'm going to give my group a name, I'm going to call it

13
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,610
admins.

14
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,600
And then what I need to do is attach permissions policies.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,370
So these are going to be the permissions that users who are in the group will obtain.

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,030
Now I'm going to search for administrator access, and what I should find is there's a few options here,

17
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,920
but I want this one that's just called administrator access with no space between.

18
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,610
Now, if I expand, I can see the permissions.

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,880
In this policy, we can see that the effect is allow the action is what's called a wild card.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,760
That's a star and the resource is star.

21
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,190
That basically means that all actions on all resources will be allowed.

22
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,080
So that's what I want.

23
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,670
I'm going to select this option, come down to the bottom and create group.

24
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,810
So now we have our group called Admins.

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,660
I'm then going to go to users on the left and I'm going to click on Add users.

26
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:00,470
I'm going to call my user Niel and I'm going to select password for a management console access.

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,280
We'll create an access key for programmatic access later on.

28
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,370
Now I'm going to enter a custom password and I'm going to deselect the requirement to change the password

29
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,300
at next log on.

30
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,850
Then I click next permissions.

31
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,610
I'm going to select the admins group to provide administrative permissions to my user account.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,290
Click next.

33
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,120
I'm not going to assign any tax.

34
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,470
I'm going to go to review and then create user, and that's it.

35
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,660
My user account is being created.

36
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,420
So now you can see we have a user account.

37
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:40,500
The user is in a group called Admins and the admins group has administrative permissions assigned through

38
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,330
this policy that's been attached.

39
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,800
So that's great.

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,190
What I want to do now is sign in as this user.

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,730
So I'm going to sign out using the menu in the top right hand corner and then log back in again.

42
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,510
Now, this time we're going to log in as an IAM user, so we need to enter our account alias.

43
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:07,110
I've entered my alias, I'm going to click on next, enter my IAM username and password.

44
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,160
And then click on sign in and that's it.

45
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:17,990
I'm now signed in using my own personal IAM user account to AWAs and I have full administrative permissions

46
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,980
over the account.
