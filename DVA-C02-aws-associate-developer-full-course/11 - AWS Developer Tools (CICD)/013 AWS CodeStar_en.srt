1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,410
CodeStar is another service that you don't need to know too much

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,880
about for the exam but it does come up here and there.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,270
So just a basic understanding of what it is and how it works will suffice.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,250
So, CodeStar enables you to quickly develop, build, and deploy applications on AWS.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,700
And it's basically a pre-configured continuous delivery

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,790
toolchain for developing, building, testing, and deploying.

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,170
So it pulls together a lot of what we've learned about in this section

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,670
into one place so that with a couple of clicks,

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,900
you're building out your entire pipeline and it's deploying your

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,400
application for you based on some pre-configured options.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,785
You can use project templates to develop applications on services like EC2,

12
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,950
Lambda, and Elastic Beanstalk.

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,730
You can also use code editors like Visual Studio, Eclipse,

14
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:53,618
or the AWS CLI.

15
00:00:53,642 --> 00:00:57,730
With CodeStar, you use IAM to manage developer identities.

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,980
And there's built-in role-based policies for secure team access.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,250
You get to share projects with your team with three different access levels.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,310
You've got owners, contributors, and viewers.

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,380
Application code is stored in AWS CodeCommit.

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,250
And CodeStar compiles and packages source code with CodeBuild.

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,730
And a pre-configured pipeline is created for you using CodePipeline.

22
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,490
The actual deployments are automated as well

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,300
using CodeDeploy and CloudFormation.

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,250
So pulling all that together,

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,460
With CodeStar, you can connect your ID

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,160
to CodeStar, your integrated development environment.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,330
CodeStar will then basically take care of everything for you.

28
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,978
So it will coordinate CloudFormation, CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.

29
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:47,230
And it will create things like buckets,

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,010
Lambda functions, API endpoints, or part of the application

31
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,526
deployment and all managed by CodeStar.

32
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:56,050
And that's it for this lesson. I will see you in the next one.
