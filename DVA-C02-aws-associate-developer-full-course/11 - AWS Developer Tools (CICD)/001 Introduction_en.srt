Hi guys and welcome to this section on the AWS developer tools.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,860
I think this is one of the most interesting and fun sections in the course.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,160
I enjoy working with these services a lot.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,470
The developer tools are used for

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,270
continuous integration and continuous deployment.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,150
Now, if you've been working in a development environment,

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,680
you know exactly what that is

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,760
and if you haven't, you've probably heard of it

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,280
and we will go into a description in one of the very first

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,180
lessons to help you make sure you understand what those concepts are.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,170
And we're gonna look at these tools provided to us by AWS for managing our code,

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,060
for testing our code, building it and deploying it to our applications.

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,280
So those are services such as

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,850
CodeCommit,

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,810
AWS Codebuild,

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,550
AWS codedeploy and AWS Codepipeline,

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,160
and it's not just theory. Of course, we're going to get hands on with these services.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,260
So I hope you enjoyed this section and I'll see you in the next lesson.
