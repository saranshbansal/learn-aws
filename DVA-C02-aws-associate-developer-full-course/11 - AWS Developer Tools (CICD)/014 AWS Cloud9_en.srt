1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,730
In this lesson, you're going to learn about AWS Cloud nine. So what is cloud nine?

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,940
It's an integrated development environment I. D.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,190
That means developers can use this environment

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,830
to write code and validate their code.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,670
So it's used by developers to write run as well as debugging code.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,670
The editor provides syntax highlighting, code completion and error checking.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,600
So it helps developers to make sure that they are writing good code.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,860
The terminal is used to navigate the fastest.

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,445
You can run commands

10
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:34,695
and you can manage code.

11
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:37,635
It also provides collaboration features that allow multiple

12
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:39,935
developers to work on the same code base,

13
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:43,325
so you can invite other developers into your project and

14
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:46,175
then you can each work on the same code base.

15
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:48,505
It also provides a range of debugging tools to

16
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:51,335
help you identify and fix errors in your code.

17
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:57,125
AWS Cloud Nine integrates with lots of AWS services, including AWS lambda

18
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,535
amazon Ec two

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,420
and AWS Codepipeline.

20
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,730
Now, there's not too much that you need to understand about this for the exam,

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,540
other than what's here,

22
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,330
but we'll go over to the AWS console and just do a really quick hands on to

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,100
show you how to create an environment and then run a really simple piece of code.

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm logged into AWS on the Cloud Nine console here and all I need

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,970
to do is create an environment and I'll just call this my demo environment.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,575
We now have a couple of options for where the Cloud nine I. D. Is going to run.

27
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:27,725
You can choose

28
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:32,835
to launch a new Ec two instance or select an existing compute instance for me,

29
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:35,105
I'm going to create a new ec two instance.

30
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:38,055
I'm going to leave the instance type as T two micro.

31
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:42,735
It's amazon Linux two for the am I got a time out here so that it will auto

32
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:46,135
hibernate after 30 minutes if there's no activity to

33
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:48,915
save you some costs on run in that instance.

34
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,755
Next we've got network settings.

35
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:52,235
So how are you going to

36
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,960
one option is systems manager and the other option is secure.

37
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,310
Shell, probably more secure to use systems manager and optionally you can define

38
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,640
the Vpc settings.

39
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,970
I'm just gonna leave all the defaults now notice

40
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,470
at the bottom there are some service rolls through.

41
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,479
I am going to be created for your account so I'm happy with that.

42
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,230
Let's create our environment.

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,920
So now it's creating the environment and as it says,

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,040
it will take several minutes potentially.

45
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,455
And once it's ready we'll go in and have a look at how to you use the editor.

46
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:24,685
So that just took a couple of minutes and now my environment has been created.

47
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:28,605
So let's click on the open button here to open the Cloud nine I. D.

48
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,505
So here we are,

49
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:31,135
there's a bit of a welcome page there which

50
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:33,455
you can obviously use and read some information.

51
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,355
I'm just going to close out of that one.

52
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:39,465
So this is the editor environment and we have the terminal at the bottom here.

53
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:42,725
So with the terminal, I can do things like create a script.

54
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:47,240
Let's create a script using python that creates the file up in the top left here,

55
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,620
you can see the the file system that you can browse, we can select our file,

56
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,100
we can put some code in here,

57
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,340
like maybe a simple Hello World function and then you can always

58
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,240
go and run that code and you get a simple Hello World.

59
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,790
So really that's it past that.

60
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,740
It's all about using this tool to actually write code, edit code. Debug code.

61
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,770
So that's outside of the scope of this course, so I'll leave it there.

62
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,380
But if you're a developer obviously this is a really useful tool that you can use.
