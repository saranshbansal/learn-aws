00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,150
Hi guys. In this lesson, we're going to create a CodePipeline

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:14,710
and we're going to integrate it with CodeCommit and Elastic Beanstalk so that we can

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,080
deploy updated code to a Beanstalk application.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,260
Now you saw this diagram before and this is exactly what we're going to be using.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,350
So we're going to have our cloned repository on our computers.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,280
We're going to make changes to code.

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,640
It's going to push that code up to CodeCommit, using Git push.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,150
And then CodeCommit and Elastic Beanstalk are both in this pipeline.

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,500
So the pipeline will then automate the movement and the deployment of that code

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,360
into Elastic Beanstalk.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,920
So I'm in the console and the first thing I'm going

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,710
to do is create a new environment in Elastic Beanstalk.

13
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,760
It's going to be a web server environment

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,660
and I'm going to just call this Developer Labs.

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,010
Now, all I really need to do, it's going to give me a default environment name.

16
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,070
I'm happy with that.

17
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,420
All I need to do is change to Node.js,

18
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,590
use the sample application, and create the environment.

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,960
So that will start with a default sample application.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,351
It's going to take a few minutes.

21
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,960
And while that's happening we can go and create the rest of our configuration.

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,011
Back on the command line, I deleted the test file that we used

23
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:21,780
in the previous lesson.

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,750
And what I'm going to do is just commit that change. So I'm going to run Git add -A

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,650
and then Git commit -m and then just

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,060
put in the description here that says deleted file.

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,290
That's done.

28
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,030
Let's just push those changes.

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,760
I just want to make sure we got a clean repository before we get started.

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,803
So that is ready.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,510
Now, in my file system I have the course download the code directory.

32
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,550
And if you go into developer tools you will find this Node.js-Blue.zip.

33
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,350
I'm going to double click that.

34
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,750
Open it up.

35
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,170
And then I'm basically just going to select all of these items,

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,250
copy those to my clipboard and then go to the directory that our repository is in.

37
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,920
So my repository directory is developer-labs in my documents directory.

38
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,160
And so I'm going to paste in all of these files.

39
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,900
So now back on the command line, if I run Git status,

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,423
we can see that we have these untracked files.

41
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:26,230
Now we're not going to do anything about that yet.

42
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,960
We don't want to commit them at this stage

43
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,160
because we haven't created our pipeline.

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,250
So those are there. Let's go over to the console and create our CodePipeline.

45
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,560
So back in the console here,

46
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,180
I'm going to head down to pipeline,

47
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,740
choose pipelines.

48
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,760
We're going to create a pipeline.

49
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,110
Just keeping the developer labs as the name for everything in this particular lesson.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,600
So let's just call that Developer Labs.

51
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,016
We're going to allow AWS to create a new service role

52
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:56,850
and it's given us the role name here.

53
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,560
We don't need to change any advanced settings. We can click on next.

54
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,710
Under source provider, choose CodeCommit.

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,460
Then you can find the repository and we're going to choose the master branch.

56
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,860
We'll leave the default settings here.

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,460
Click on next.

58
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,260
For build provider, this is where you can choose a build provider.

59
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,263
We're going to use CodeBuild a bit later on in this section.

60
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,950
But for now we're going to skip the build stage.

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,350
So I'll confirm that I'm skipping.

62
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,150
For deployment provider, I do need to select an option.

63
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,050
So you can see all the different deployment providers that are supported here.

64
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,480
Now we have our application in Elastic Beanstalk

65
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,460
so Beanstalk will be able to push the updates.

66
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,850
So we choose beanstalk.

67
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,060
It's automatically selected the region.

68
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,950
I can choose my app.

69
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,110
And then my environment name.

70
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,660
And click on next.

71
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,660
And that's everything. I just scroll down and create the pipeline.

72
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,670
So that's it. The pipeline has been created.

73
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,671
Now what you'll find happens is it's automatically going to

74
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:04,230
try and pull any changes from CodeCommit.

75
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,850
Now, we don't have any at this stage. So that process should actually fail.

76
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,460
And now we can see that that did fail.

77
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,400
And if we choose details, it says the process to upload the contents of

78
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,660
the repository failed for the following reason, null.

79
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,750
So there was nothing there,

80
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,149
And that's to be expected.

81
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,640
So let's go back to the command line

82
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,150
and we're going to commit our files and push them into the repository.

83
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,070
So back on the command line. I'm going to run Git add

84
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,560
-A

85
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,660
Git commit -m and add a description.

86
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,220
And those are being committed.

87
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,160
So now let's push those changes up to our repository.

88
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:48,650
And that's done.

89
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,630
So back in our pipeline,

90
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,010
what we should find is very soon it's going to start checking CodeCommit.

91
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,770
There we go.

92
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,110
It's checked. It succeeded.

93
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,360
And now we're in the deployment. That's in progress.

94
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,760
So it's going to deploy those changes to Elastic Beanstalk.

95
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
So in Beanstalk, before it changes

96
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,040
I should have shown this before but you click on here and it's green.

97
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,140
Okay so this is pre-change.

98
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,670
So the actual congratulations message has a green background.

99
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,550
That's the default when you use the sample application.

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,680
And we can see that there is an update happening and once that's complete,

101
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,960
the background should change to blue. So let's give that a moment.

102
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,960
So the update is complete.

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,511
Let's go to Beanstalk and let's just give this page a refresh.

104
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:33,860
And now the background has changed to blue.

105
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,930
So looking at our diagram,

106
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,650
what we've done is we've added the files which changed the background to blue

107
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,691
into our repository on our local computer, the clone

108
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:46,830
of the repositories in CodeCommit.

109
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,790
We then pushed those changes up to CodeCommit

110
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,550
and CodePipeline has then picked up those changes,

111
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,590
pushed them through the Beanstalk and Beanstalk has then updated the application.

112
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,830
So that's it for this lesson. And don't bring anything down.

113
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,200
We're going to use Elastic Beanstalk and our pipeline in another hands-on lesson.
