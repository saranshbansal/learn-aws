00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,960
Welcome to the exam cram for developer tools and c i C D.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,930
Codecommit is a fully managed source control service that hosts secure.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,379
Get based repositories

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,360
gets an open source distributed source control system gives

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,710
you a centralized repository for all your code Binaries,

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,330
Images and libraries.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,370
It tracks and manages code changes

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,510
and maintains version history.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,000
It also manages updates from multiple sources

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,960
and enables collaboration.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,260
Codecommit. Repositories are private.

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,520
Codecommit is integrated with Jenkins Codebuild

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,920
and other continuous integration tools.

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,960
You can transfer your files to and from Codecommit using https or ssh.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,870
You need to configure your get

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,840
client to communicate with codecommit repositories.

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,980
I am supports co commit with three types of credentials, get credentials.

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,950
Ssh keys and also access keys.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,700
Codepipeline is a managed continuous delivery service

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,610
that helps you automate release pipelines,

21
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,920
it automates the build, test and deploy phases of your release process

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,850
every time a code change happens.

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,120
Codepipeline provides tooling integrations for many aws

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,960
and 3rd party software.

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,190
Code Guru provides intelligent recommendations for improving

26
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,860
application performance efficiency and code quality.

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,360
Code Guru reviews, java and python code and offers suggestions for improvement

28
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,460
suggestions are based on best practices.

29
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,830
It finds complex issues such as resource leak and security analysis

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,450
is made up of two services.

31
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,430
Code guru reviewer

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,860
and code Guru. Profiler.

33
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,260
Codebuild is a fully managed continuous integration service.

34
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,460
It compiles your source code

35
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,600
runs test and produces software packages

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,260
that are ready to deploy.

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,670
Codebuild takes the source code from github

38
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,250
Codecommit Codepipeline. S free etcetera

39
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,810
build instructions can be defied in the code

40
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,230
using the builds back dot y mel file,

41
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,460
Output logs can be sent to S three

42
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,880
and cloudwatch logs.

43
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,380
Codedeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments.

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,220
It deploys to ec two instances on premises instances.

45
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,680
Lambda functions

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,930
and DCs.

47
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,660
You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application. Content

48
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,860
codedeploy application contains information about what to

49
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,060
deploy and how to deploy it.

50
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,260
You need to choose the compute platform so easy to slash on premises or lambda or E C s

51
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,460
if you use easy to or on premises,

52
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,800
traffic is directed using an in place or blue

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
green deployment type to a replacement set of instances.

54
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,410
For lambda traffic is shifted using a canary linear or all at once configuration

55
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,860
and that's to a new version of the function.

56
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,160
For e C.

57
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,480
S codedeploy performs a blue green deployment by installing an

58
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,760
updated version of the application as a new replacement task set

59
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,240
for e C S,

60
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,520
traffic is shifted using canary linear or all

61
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,260
at once configuration to the replacement task set.

62
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,640
Note that all lambda and CCS deployments are blue green and

63
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,260
easy to on premises deployment can be in place or blue green

64
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,880
code star enables you to quickly develop, build and deploy applications on AWS.

65
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,420
It's a pre configured continuous delivery toolchain for developing building,

66
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,850
testing and deploying.

67
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,060
You can use code editors such as Visual Studio Eclipse or the AWS Cli

68
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,910
It uses I am to manage developer identities

69
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,610
and has built in role based policies for secure team access,

70
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,890
Application code is stored in codecommit.

71
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,460
It compiles and packages. Source code using codebuild,

72
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,959
and a pre configured pipeline is used through codepipeline.

73
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,440
It also has automated deployments with codedeploy and cloud formation.

74
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,360
That's it for this exam, cram. I'll see you in the next lesson.
