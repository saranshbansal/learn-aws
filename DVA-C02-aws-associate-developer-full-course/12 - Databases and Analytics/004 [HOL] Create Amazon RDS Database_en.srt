1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,680
In this lesson, we're going to go into the console and create an RDS MySQL database.

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,590
I'm logged into the AWS management console and I'm on the dashboard for Amazon RDS.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,040
Now, as you can see, AWS want to push you towards the Aurora,

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,050
so there's this great big button up here.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,240
But what we want to do is we're going to create an RDS MySQL database.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,420
So, under databases choose create database. We can then choose the standard or the easy create.

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,800
We're going to stick with standard.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,690
Again, they're trying to push you towards Aurora, but we're going to select MySQL.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,570
Now, if we scroll down to templates, there's three pre-defined templates, production, dev/test, and

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,060
free tier.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,930
Now, we will switch to free tier in a moment.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,860
But there are some configuration options that are removed when you do that.

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,890
So, I want to show you first those configuration options.

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,980
Now, I'm going to call my database Digicloud.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,280
I'm going to leave the master username as admin, enter a password, and then confirm that password.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,880
You then get some options for the DB instance class.

17
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,450
And there's quite a lot of options here, many of which will cost quite a bit of money.

18
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,650
So you want to be careful here.

19
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,680
We're going to use a t2.micro, but it's not available at this point in time. So, I'll leave it on standard.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,360
And we're going to scroll down.

21
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,940
Next, you have storage. Now,

22
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:31,750
as you can see, by default, we're going to have a provisioned IOPS SSD io1 volume with 100 GiB

23
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,170
allocated and a provisioned IOPS of 3,000.

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,410
Now this is for this production database, so it's going to change soon when we switch to a free tier

25
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,010
database.

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,320
With RDS, you can auto scale the storage layer and by default, that is enabled.

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,860
We also have Multi-AZ, which on this production template is also enabled by default.

28
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,530
That's going to change when we switch to free tier as well.

29
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,380
I'm going to leave it in the default VPC.

30
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,270
I'm not going to change the subnet group. Now, for public access,

31
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,440
if you want your database to be accessible from the internet, then you would choose

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:16,000
yes. If you have instances in EC2 and you want to talk to your database on a private IP, then you

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,480
would leave it on

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,900
no.

35
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,680
By default, the default security group is added.

36
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,880
Now, bear in mind, there might not be a rule that allows the relevant port.

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,360
The port is 3306 for MySQL.

38
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,490
So if you do want to connect an EC2 instance to your database, you'll need to make sure that your

39
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,950
security group has a rule allowing 3306 from your application instances.

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,160
There are three options here for database authentication.

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,040
The default is password, and we're going to leave it on that one.

42
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:52,030
You can also have a password with IAM database authentication, and you can choose Password and Kerberos,

43
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,500
and then you would add a directory.

44
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,680
Now we don't have a directory, let's leave it on password.

45
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,620
We then have some additional configuration options.

46
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,180
Now you can see the estimated monthly cost here, and as you can see, it does cost quite a bit of money

47
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:04,870
this database.

48
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,480
So, you certainly don't want to launch this one.

49
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,840
Now, let's just expand additional configuration.

50
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,000
We do need to provide a name here.

51
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,860
I'm going to call it Digicloud.

52
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,090
Automated backups are enabled by default with seven-day retention.

53
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,460
Now remember, if you don't want to have automated backups, you would put it to zero days and the

54
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,170
maximum is 35.

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,850
We can leave it on seven.

56
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,420
You can select a backup window of your preference or leave it on no preference. When using the production

57
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,020
template,

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,210
encryption is enabled by default, and it's using the AWS RDS default key.

59
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,370
So, let's just leave that option

60
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,440
for now, that is going to be removed when we go to free tier as well. There's then performance insights,

61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,650
which is enabled by default, and that will log more detailed information about performance and you

62
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,510
can retain that data and encrypt it.

63
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,440
Monitoring, there's another option for monitoring here where you can get more granular, detailed information

64
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,020
about things like the threads of your CPU and the granularity can go right down to one second.

65
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,590
Under maintenance,

66
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:17,149
we have the auto minor version upgrade enabled. So, that will update automatically for minor database

67
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,260
version updates and that will do so during the maintenance window.

68
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,470
And we haven't specified a preference here.

69
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,490
Deletion protection simply means that you can't delete your database without an extra step.

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,630
Now, we're going to scroll back up to the top and switch to Free tier.

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,470
So, back at the top of the page, just scroll down to where the templates are and go to free tier. Now, most

72
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,760
of the settings will remain.

73
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:49,170
So, we've still got our database identifier, our admin and password. For burstable classes,

74
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,060
we now have a t2.micro option. So that's selected by default.

75
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,930
You'll notice that the amount of storage has reduced. Multi-AZ is now greyed out.

76
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,840
And when we scroll all the way down to the additional configuration, there's no option here now for

77
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,540
encrypting our database. But we're going to get around that in another lesson. So, we can leave now

78
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,920
all of these defaults, scroll to the bottom, and then create our database.

79
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,440
The database is now in a creating state.

80
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:23,050
Now, it can take quite a while with RDS for creating databases and modifying databases.

81
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,160
So, you want to sit back and be patient for a few minutes and then we'll continue.

82
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,890
The database creation has now completed and our database is available. Now,

83
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,440
you can see a couple of things here, such as the DB identifier and the region and availability zone

84
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,510
and the size of the database as well.

85
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,390
Now if we actually click on the database on the left,

86
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,930
we now get quite a bit more information. You can see here the end point, so this is the end point that

87
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:57,280
you would use in your application to connect to this database. And you would use the port 3306

88
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,050
because this is MySQL.

89
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,110
You can see which availability zone the database is running in, the VPC, subnet group, subnets, and so on.

90
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,530
This particular database is not publicly accessible.

91
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,700
You can see the security rules here. Now, as I mentioned before, to connect to this database

92
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,580
you'll also need a rule allowing inbound to port 3306.

93
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,100
We don't have any replication at this stage.

94
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,870
Now let's head up to the top.

95
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,300
Under monitoring, we get some relatively basic information about the database.

96
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,150
There are also some more advanced options for monitoring, including enhanced monitoring,

97
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:42,690
OS process list and performance insights, but they're not enabled on this database. Under logs

98
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,380
and events,

99
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,040
we can see where our CloudWatch alarms are if we have any,

100
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,250
some of the recent events, and then the log files.

101
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,000
Now, if you choose one of these log files, you can click on view

102
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,080
and it will actually show you the log file, there's nothing really in this one.

103
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,560
So, let's close out of there. Under configuration,

104
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:07,560
you get a summary of the current configuration of the database. And then under maintenance and backups,

105
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,650
you can see the backups that have been created.

106
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,920
So, we have the automated backups enabled here,

107
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,100
we can see a snapshot that's being created at the bottom.

108
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,310
Now, if we head over to snapshots on the left here, we have the system generated snapshots and we've

109
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,000
already got one.

110
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,250
And then we have manual snapshots.

111
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,850
So, in here, we can click on take snapshots, choose our database, and I'm going to create a snapshot.

112
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,130
I'm going to call it Digicloud unencrypted because this is an unencrypted database,

113
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,330
so we're creating a snapshot and that snapshot is going to be unencrypted.

114
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,450
So let's take the snapshot. And that task is now going to run.

115
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,090
And that would take a few minutes.

116
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Let's go back up to databases, choose our database, and we also have the actions menu here.

117
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,350
Under actions, you can create a read replica, take a snapshot, restore to a specific point in time

118
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,960
using the automated backups, and you can stop, reboot, and delete your database as well.

119
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,290
Modify will take you back to the wizard, where you can change options like the DB instance size you're

120
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:13,710
using.

121
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,570
Now that's it for this lesson.

122
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,060
And what we're going to do in the next hands-on lesson is we're going to create a read replica and enable

123
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,470
Multi-AZ.
