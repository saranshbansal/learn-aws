1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,740
In this lesson, you're going to learn about the Amazon OpenSearch service, also known as Elasticsearch.

2
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:18,220
So the opensearch service is the successor to Amazon Elasticsearch Service.

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,530
Now, don't worry if you see one name or the other in exam questions because the concepts I'm going

4
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,030
to teach you are the same for both.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,030
So what is it?

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,720
Well, it's a fully managed service that you can use for searching, visualizing and analyzing text

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,310
and unstructured data.

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,290
It's petabyte scale and it's secure so you can deploy it into an Amazon VPC.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,810
Integrate with IAM and you can encrypt at rest and in transit.

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,410
It's also highly available and scalable.

11
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,970
Now you deploy nodes and replicas into and across availability zones, and we'll go into that in a bit

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,360
more depth.

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,960
later on.

14
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,820
So it's a distributed search and analytics suite.

15
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:10,070
It's based on the popular open source elastic search service, and it supports queries using SQL syntax

16
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,620
and integrates with open source tools.

17
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,130
Now you scale by adding or removing instances.

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,540
It's not a surplus service.

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,760
You're using the underlying EC2 service for running your open search.

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,880
We have availability in up to free availability zones, and you can back it up using snapshots.

21
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,830
You can also enable encryption at rest and in transit.

22
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,950
Now, how do we deploy open search?

23
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,790
Well, you create a cluster, you can do so through the management console, the API or the CLI.

24
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,930
Now, a cluster is also known as an opensearch service domain.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,680
You specify the number of instances and the instance types, and you can have storage options, including

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,070
ultra warm or cold storage, depending on your needs.

27
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,620
So the next thing is, once we've deployed our cluster, we need some data so that we can use that for

28
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,370
populating our open search cluster and then searching and analyzing it.

29
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:15,020
So data can come from various different sources, including Kinesis Data, Firehose, Log Stash and

30
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,890
the ElasticSearch, an open search APIs.

31
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,340
So data gets ingested from these different sources.

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,270
Now, we might then use an open source tool like Cabana to search, visualize and analyze that data

33
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,050
by pointing Cabana Dashboard at the open search service.

34
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:41,300
As I mentioned before, we can deploy our open search cluster into a VPC, so that will allow secure

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,280
intra VPC communications.

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,800
If you've got your other components of your solution inside a VPC, then it means you never have to

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,690
traverse outside the VPC.

38
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:58,340
Now, a VPN or proxy will be required to connect from the internet, whereas public domains are directly

39
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,000
accessible.

40
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:05,000
So if you deploy in a public domain, then you can directly access your cluster from

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,480
the internet.

42
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,040
Otherwise, if you deploy in a VPC, you'll need a VPN or proxy service.

43
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:16,070
When you deploy your open search cluster into a VPC, you cannot use IP based access policies.

44
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,270
Now there's also some other limitations of VPC deployments.

45
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,720
You can't switch from a VPC deployment to a public endpoints.

46
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,600
And the reverse is also true.

47
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,610
You also can't launch your domain within a VPC that uses dedicated tenancy.

48
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,270
After you place a domain within a VPC, you can't then move it to a different VPC.

49
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,730
But if you need to, you can change the subnets and security group settings within the VPC.

50
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:50,570
Now there's another concept you need to understand for exam questions, and that's the elk stack. elk

51
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,990
stands for ElasticSearch, LogStash and Kibana.

52
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,770
So that's where you're actually combining these different services together.

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,180
So let's say we have an open search service domain.

54
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,930
We have logstash and that is ingesting data into open search.

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,320
Then Kibana is actually used as the dashboard to then perform that search and analytics on the data

56
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,060
that's in our open search cluster.

57
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,829
This is a very popular combination of different projects, and you can use this to aggregate logs from

58
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,240
systems and applications and analyze them and create visualizations as well.

59
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:32,830
Use cases include visualizing application and infrastructure, monitoring, data troubleshooting and

60
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,120
security analytics.

61
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,430
Let's have a look at access control with open search, so we've got a few different options.

62
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,080
We've got resource based policies and these are called domain access policies.

63
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,870
Identity based policies which get attached to users or roles are the same as with any other kind of

64
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,630
identity based access that we've looked at in the course.

65
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,410
And then we have IP based policy to remember you can't use these if you're using a cluster of apps.

66
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,270
These restrict access to one or more IP addresses or side blocks.

67
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,690
And then lastly, we have fine grained access control.

68
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,830
Now this will provide role based access control gives you security at the index document and field level

69
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:21,580
open search dashboards, multi-tenancy and HTTP based authentication for opensearch and opensearch

70
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,210
dashboards.

71
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,090
We then have the authentication options.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,930
These include using federation with SAML, so the security assertion markup language to on-premises

73
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,630
directories.

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,480
So maybe if you have an Active Directory on-premises, you can federate using SAML.

75
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,400
You can use Amazon Cognito with social identity providers as well.

76
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,720
Lastly, I'm going to cover some opensearch best practices now.

77
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,460
This is really important to understand because these do come up quite a lot and in some questions.

78
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,360
So one best practice is that you should deploy your opensearch data instances across three availability

79
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,550
zones for the best availability.

80
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,840
You should provision your instances in multiples of three for equal distribution across AZs.

81
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,760
And if three AZ are not available, as is the case in some regions, then use to AZs with equal

82
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,960
numbers of instances.

83
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:26,280
You should use three, dedicated masternodes, configure at least one replica for each index and apply

84
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,580
restrictive resource based access policies to the domain so you can use that all fine grained access

85
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,120
control.

86
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,960
You should create the domain within an Amazon VPC and for sensitive data, enable nodes to

87
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,450
node Encryption and encryption at rest.

88
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,900
Now that's it for opensearch.

89
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,020
Now remember, open search and ElasticSearch are essentially the same thing.

90
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,780
So if you see even those names in the exam, then the concepts in this lesson will apply the same.

91
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,120
Now it does come up in quite a few exam questions these days, but they shouldn't be too difficult,

92
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,400
and you certainly don't need strong hands on knowledge of ElasticSearch or open search, as it's now

93
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,790
called.

94
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,100
Instead, just understand the concepts in this lesson, and that should do you quite well for the exam.
